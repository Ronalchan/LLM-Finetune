538721,2,It is probably a typo for bug 436276 but that's wrong too as strokeWidth is a length. I'd say bug 534028 makes more sense as a dependency.,POTENTIAL_SOLUTION_DESIGN,1,FULL_TEXT
538721,3,"Thanks for the report, Jesse!
Robert is correct on both counts. (FWIW, in bug 436276, I intended ""non-length"" to mean ""non-nsSVGLength2"" -- and strokeWidth is non-nsSVGLength2. Hence the dependency on that bug).
In any case, bug 534028 is more granular, and when it's fixed, this test will pass.  So that's indeed a better bug # to reference there.

551837,1,"Just by adding ""__arm__"" to the i386 #ifdef in js_DoubleToECMAInt32 seems to get us a 5% performance improvement on Cortex-A8. The i386 code in the block looks fairly generic so I don't see any harm in doing this (though it does require IEEE format doubles). It may also benefit x64, but I have no idea about how x64 handles floating-point and there may be some reason why it won't work.
5% seems surprisingly large (and may just indicate an anomalous result), so I want to investigate further before filing a patch, but there's certainly something we can do here. Also, if the function really does take as much profile time as the improvement would suggest, it may be worth hand-writing some assembly to do this (unless the compiler output is already good).
Also, js_DoubleToECMAUint32 is a potential target, so I'll have a look at that one too.",PROBLEM_MOTIVATION,0,FULL_TOKEN

 * I don't like using assembly in this way, particularly outside the back-ends, but I couldn't get close to the performance of this routine using pure C.

 * I've added many comments to my assembly to try to explain what's going on, but this does make the code look somewhat long (even though the output is tiny). Suggestions are welcome! The comments are important; I don't want this to be a write-only routine, and this kind of assembly algorithm can get unreadable pretty quickly.

Patch v1.0
nsEditor::mFlags is set only when nsEditor::Init() is called.
nsPlaintextEditor::SetFlags() and nsHTMLEditor::SetFlags() don't call nsEditor::SetFlags(), so, nsEditor::mFlags are not modified forever.
I guess that this makes a problem after type attribute or readonly attribute of <input> element is modified and some code path which refer nsEditor::mFlags run. However, I'm not sure there are actual problems.
My patch removes nsEditor::mFlags. It's not needed. And the code should check the flags via GetFlags() method.

Patch v1.0
separated from bug 552914.
Current nsEditorEventListener stores the editor as nsIEditor. However, if we change this to nsEditor, we can remove may casts and QIs.
And also we can remove null check of mEditor because it's set at constructor. And it's never modified, so, it always valid pointer.
There are some random thought.
1. nsEditorEventListener::KeyPress() still QIs nsIPlaintextEditor.
nsEditorEventListener is for nsEditor, so, we shouldn't store the editor as nsPlaintextEditor I think. 
I think that we should move HandleKeyPress() from nsIPlaintextEditor to nsIEditor. Besides, nsIPlaintextEditor should inherit nsIEditor. Then, we don't change the interfaces actually. (And also we can move the flags of nsIPlaintextEditor to nsIEditor too)
If we do so, we can move the contents of nsEditorEventListener::KeyPress() to nsEditor::HandleKeyPress() and nsPlaintextEditor::HandleKeyPress().
# But I'm not sure whether the method should be defined in idl because there are not merits of it being scriptable.
2. nsEditorEventListener::MouseClick() still QIs nsIEditorMailSupport.
nsIEditorMailSupport is implemented nsPlaintextEditor, so, the contents of nsEditorEventListener can be moved to nsEditor::HandleMouseClick() and nsPlaintextEditor::HandleMouseClick() like HandleKeyPress().",CODE_IMPLEMENTATION,1,FULL_TOKEN

Like for BasicLayers, I think the CanvasLayerOGL code should defer all the real work until RenderLayer in case there are multiple Updated calls. Seems simpler that way anyway.

Fix character class range with builtin character class on any side.
Plain true/false don't do it for me for readability, suggest checkRangeValid/checkRangeInvalid methods forwarding to one common method.
Add in some tests with \b and \B since those aren't treated as character class escapes.
Good style appears to suggest m_sawCharacterClass, to make upstreaming easier.
As far as good style goes, it appears that this code parenthesizes equality expressions that aren't the whole of conditions -- so |((m_character == '-') && m_sawCharacterClass)|.
I think this would be more readable if you didn't put the sawCharacterClass in the else-block.  It makes more sense (even if one doesn't subscribe to else-after-return being evil) to say that *if* the just-passed character class starts a range, *then* it's an error and you exit.  But the sawCharacterClass assignment applies to both arms of the if below, so it seems it makes more sense to something like this:
(Add parentheses per the earlier comment.)
I had trouble understanding both parts of your condition here -- suggest adding something noting that the first part handles things like [a-\d] and the second part handles things like [\w-\s].  For that matter, the most obvious place for any of these checks, in |case cachedCharacter|, is only hit (I think) in the case of [\w-a] or [\w-\b] -- may as well add a comment to that effect there, too.",CODE_REVIEW,0,FULL_TOKEN

1. Load above page with Fx3.6 and Flash Player 10.1.x.x
2. Click a link in the Flash Player which is center of the page (the radio program list)
Then, you cannot use non-Roman keyboard layout on Fx.
Flash Player disables non-Roman keyboard layout and if you click the link, Flash Player doesn't recover the keyboard layout state when it's destroying. Gecko stores latest keyboard layout state when Gecko changes it because 10.4 doesn't provide any APIs for getting the state. And Gecko reduces unnecessary API call at nsTSMManager::SetRomanKeyboardsOnly(). Therefore, Gecko doesn't restore the keyboard state until Gecko's password field gets focus.

This probably wants to check Tag(), too, something like this:
  if (nsGkAtoms::start == aAttribute || 
      (nsGkAtoms::reversed == aAttribute && nsGkAtoms::ol == mContent->Tag()) {
since reversed only has an effect on <ol> elements -- right?  (Later in this patch, you check Tag() in the same spot where you check for reversed)
(I don't imagine this will affect behavior, but it should just save us some unnecessary notifications)
[...]
Maybe add a MOZ_ASSERT(hc, ...) there to document what that comment's claiming?  Then if FrameStartsCounterScope() gets a bug at some point, we'll get a helpful assertion-failure instead of a mysterious segfault.
s/lis/list/
I wonder if we might even want to make this ""ordinal -= increment"" instead of ""++ordinal""? (and check ""increment < 0"" instead of ""== -1"" in the ""else if"" check above it)
That way, abritrary increment values should Just Work (e.g. if the WHATWG introduces ""<ol increment=""3"" reversed>"" at some point in the future)
That could be premature generalization, though -- the existing code is good too.
[...]
Might be worth asserting that aIncrement is either 1 or -1 here, just as a sanity-check, since (for now) those are the only values that we're expecting to add.
It's probably worth having a test where we wrap past 0 into negative territory, too -- like this test, but with start=""1"" maybe?
Also, since this is actual feature-work (rather than a random-bugfix), these tests probably deserve ""real"" names instead of ""601912-*"", and they probably want to live in layout/reftests/list-item/ instead of layout/reftests/bugs.
Also: I noticed that http://blog.whatwg.org/reverse-ordered-lists mentions that XHTML needs this to be specified as <ol reversed=""reversed""> -- does that work right now?  (and do we reject other values for the ""reversed"" attribute in XHTML, as it sounds like we should?)
It'd probably be good to add XHTML reftests showing that reversed=""reversed"" works and reversed=""anything_else"" is ignored.

 A. Remove the line mentioned in Comment 6.

I just tried (A) -- removing the regressing line -- on TryServer, and it doesn't actually break any unit tests, which is encouraging.  I'm guessing it'd be possible to construct a -moz-element testcase that would end up painting stale data as a result of that change, but I'm not immediately sure what that testcase would look like.
(B) and (C) might be better for correctness, but I'm not entirely sure how to best check for cycles there. Maybe we'd disallow rendering-observer-notifications being sent to an element from any of its ancestors?  And even if that's the right thing to do, it could still be undesirable perf-wise (it'd make us walk the DOM tree on every InvalidateViaReferencedElement or AddRenderingObserver call).
Also: I'm not sure that (C) would work after tree-surgery -- i.e. when we re-parent an element, do we un-register and then re-register it as a rendering observer?  If not, then you could still construct testcases that fail here, if they just do some node-reparenting at the last minute.

 (4) At the end of our current reflow, we call HandlePostedReflowCallbacks, which runs a callback to update our scroll frame's scrollbars. (noted in comment 3)

Uh oh, shame on me for lack of test coverage. I'll write a test that would break asap.
The call to InvalidateDirectRenderingObservers has the purpose of invalidating (purely visually) any elements that use the current element as a -moz-element paint server. The fact that it can also cause reflows is unfortunate, and in fact it's never necessary, at least not from nsIFrame::InvalidateInternal. (It is necessary when, for example, a filter's overflow actually changes, but then we're notified elsewhere and don't need to do anything in InvalidateInternal.)
Maybe we should split rendering observers into two types? One ""visual"" type for -moz-element and another for filters, masks, etc. Then we'd only invalidate visual observers from nsIFrame::InvalidateInternal, which must not cause reflows, and the problem is gone.",POTENTIAL_SOLUTION_DESIGN,1,FULL_TEXT

I mean, the patches here and in bug 587336 are fine, but maybe the fact that we're unnecessarily triggering restyles during invalidation at all has caused more bugs of this kind which we don't know about yet.

627984,14,"There is a bunch of bugs here actually. In js_NativeSet we never trigger the method write barrier if a property is added (added=true), because we think that can't cause a shape change, but that's not true for watchpoint setters which fire for additions as well since they are persistent. So in other words watch makes our write barrier more expensive in general. Super lame.
There is a second bug. The slot is initialized to undefined when we call the setter, so even if we would call the method write barrier it would see undefined (old) == undefined (new) and not brand.
I think this is all pretty seriously broken and all sorts of unsafe. I vote for a hard blocker. This probably wants jorendorff or brendan, though I think I can fix it if push comes to shove.",SOLUTION_REVIEW,1,FULL_TOKEN
627984,15,What a mess.,UNCODED,0,UNMATCHED
627984,16,"OK. My first instinct here was to trigger the method *read* barrier in UpdateWatchpointShape. If a method property would be watched, the barrier would convert it an ordinary data property. Then you would watch that.
But that would go seriously against the grain, because UpdateWatchpointShape gets called at a point where the method property has been added, but before the slot is filled.
So for now watchpoints need to know about the method barrier. (Which after all is only consistent. They know about everything else.)
I have a sort of patch, but unfortunately the assertions I'm trying to add keep failing, and I'm out of time for the day.",SOLUTION_REVIEW,1,FULL_TOKEN
627984,17,"Elaborating a little on comment 16:
There are three bugs I know very clearly how to fix.
1. js_watch_set passes the property's old slot value (the one we're about to overwrite) to wp->handler without checking to see if the property is a method. If it's a method, the old value is an uncloned function object that must not be exposed to script! The fix is for js_watch_set to trip the read barrier before calling wp->handler.
2. js_watch_set can get called at an unfortunate time. The order of adding a data property, such as a method, is like this:
    - add the shape to the object
    - call the setter
    - store the value in the slot
So suppose we watch a property, then delete it, and then use JSOP_INITMETHOD to create it again. Here's what happens:
    - add the (watched method) shape to the object
    - call js_watch_set, which calls wp->handler
    - store the uncloned function object in the slot
Note js_watch_set is called *after* the METHOD property is added to obj but *before* the slot is assigned. So the slot value is undefined. To my mind, this state is a violation of the method invariant. We do not want to be calling back into the interpreter with the object in that state. The fix, again, is for js_watch_set to trip the method barrier before calling wp->handler.
3. The watchpoint handler could delete the property and re-add it as a method property again. Then whatever value it returns must not be stored in the slot of that method property; it would violate the method invariant. So after the handler returns, we probably need to call methodWriteBarrier. (This one I'm not quite sure about.)
There are also at least 2 other issues:
4. Bug 631723 - Deleted watchpoints can make obj->addProperty/putProperty return a shape not in obj.
5. If wp->handler deletes the property, wp->shape is not set to NULL. I think I have seen wp->shape be wrong (that is, != obj->nativeLookup(propid)) in other circumstances, too, which would be bad. This needs another look, possibly in a follow-up bug.",POTENTIAL_SOLUTION_DESIGN,1,FULL_TOKEN
627984,18,"6. js_NativeSet skips the slot write if the before and after shape of the property are different. This means that unwatching from a watchpoint can cause the slot write to be skipped:
var obj = {m: 'o'};
var other = {a: 1};
obj.watch(""m"", function (id, oldval, newval) { 
        delete other.a;
        obj.unwatch('m');

    });
obj.m = 'n';  // since the watchpoint unconditionally returns newval,
              // this value should not be lost

Two reasons not to do it that way: first, js_UpdateWatchpointsForShape is called at a weird time; the method property exists but the slot isn't populated yet. No big deal; I could populate the slot from shape->methodValue(), then trip the read barrier.
Second, and more importantly, js_UpdateWatchpointsForShape's relevant caller (js_SetPropertyHelper) doesn't expect it to trip the read barrier, so it will unconditionally write the noncloned function to the slot. To avoid that, the caller would have to check whether js_UpdateWatchpointsForShape changed the shape. That adds a branch to the no-watchpoint path, and it complicates code outside jsdbgapi.cpp.

WIP: cache with purging.
This is close to done, but I have to fix a few things that are bothering me:
1) I'm pretty sure this assertion method doesn't work with background sweeping. I *could* deallocate the cache pre-mark and assume refcounting correctness, but the debug refcounting assertions are nice. I either have to figure out a way to do it in JS_THREADSAFE that doesn't make your eyes bleed, or only perform the assertions when !JS_THREADSAFE (which seems undesirable).
2) The string regexp methods are violating the RegExpPrivate boundary quite heavily in order to avoid creating a RegExpObject. This leads to more annoying problems in the refcount assertions where I have to say, ""check that the string regexp methods are appropriate messing around with RegExpPrivates behind our back,"" which is gross.
3) Switch the RegExpPrivates from taking JSContext parameters to JSRuntime parameters now that they live in the ThreadData.
4) There's too many scary verbs on the RegExp data structures... purge, finalize, reset, decref. If I can't consolidate any of those verbs they at least need a big comment at the top of RegExpObject.h to say how they all work together with the ThreadData cache.",CODE_IMPLEMENTATION,1,FULL_TOKEN

The RegExpObjectBuilder idiom feels weird to me.  Maybe it's the name that feels strange.  I don't know.  My concerns about it are not coherent enough to suggest something better.

If this is a RegExpObject, shouldn't we have a method to do this, that takes in an AIR<>, rather than do it all manually here?
The free-floating decrefs here (and increfs in callers) are not happy-making.  I assume the semantics here are that the caller passes ownership of his reference to this function, which is then responsible for decrementing it at the appropriate time (either now, in case of error, or later when the reobj dies)?  I suspect based on the name this is what WebKit's PassRefPtr (?) templates are for; maybe we should have something similar.

The small V8 regression was due to some regexp compilation being duplicated in v8-regexp. The cache largely fixes that issue, but it still gets cleared out and recompiles regexps about 6 times during v8-regexp. This at least gets our regexp score back where it was, but there's followup work we can do by only purging on a GC_SHRINK (thereby not clearing out compiled regexps during v8-regexp). That'll be left to the v8-regexp investigation bug.",CODE_IMPLEMENTATION,1,FULL_TOKEN

There is still some imprecision because of a few accesses to Math which are JSOP_NAME rather than GNAME.  That can be fixed similarly to how we do monitored SETNAME/SETPROP, will file separately.  For now adding '| 0' to the calls to Math.round and Math.floor should fix precision.  I get these times:

Looking at shark, JM seems to be getting killed by the slow paths it takes for the '(...) | 0' operations in C's inner loop.  We try to branchTruncateToInt32 on these, but on average about 1.5 times per iteration this truncation fails (the double does not fit in an int32) and we take I think a very expensive slow path.

1. Know that 'a' is an integer within the loop in the C function.  It is initially an array but is then reused as an integer.  Could use SSA-style techniques to add some flow sensitivity to let the inference distinguish its uses, or (probably better) make a Crankshaft-style speculation it is an integer within the loop body and hoist a check to the loop header.  This is worth about 20ms (easy to test by hand).
2. Hoist array bounds checks and LICM the slots pointer computation on the 'd' array.
3. Regalloc tuning on the loop, get another GPR (heavy register pressure here).

This exposed an existing bug in the recompilation mechanism, where we would convert integer slots to doubles even if the recompiled code knew they were integers.  The FrameState can be either more or less precise than the inferred types, and we only require args/locals inferred as int|double to be doubles at join points (the revised algorithm only uses the FrameState, not the inferred types, to figure out what needs repatching, and is a good deal cleaner).

Build Identifier: Thunderbird 3.4a1pre
When the inbox is refreshed in Thunderbird and the number of unread messages changes, the inbox label (and consequently the name of its accessible) changes, but a property-changed::accessible-name is not fired.  This causes problems with Orca and AT-SPI2 since AT-SPI expects to receive the event and continues to read the old cached value (unless AT-SPI 2.0.2 or later is used and setCacheMask is called to disable caching of the name--I plan on proposing that Orca do this for now as a work-around).
As I was testing, I saw the property-changed event being fired when I had the setCacheMask work-around in place but not when I did not have it included, so either this only happens sometimes or the event can be triggered somehow (perhaps calling atk_object_get_name on the accessible triggers the event).  I'm marking this as ""happens sometimes"" since I'm not entirely sure which is the case.
Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Orca.  If there is a setCacheMask call in the Thunderbird script, then remove it.
2. Open Thunderbird.
3. Do something to cause the number of unread inbox messages to change.
Actual Results:  
Orca continues to read the old inbox label.
Expected Results:  
I would have expected Thunderbird to send a property-changed::accessible-name when the label gets updated, so Orca would read the new label when it gains focus.  Note that it should also be possible to reproduce this with Accerciser using similar steps.",PROBLEM_DESCRIPTION,0,FULL_TOKEN

 - it seems to force on V-Sync
 - we start repainting window background behind our GL context
Every time we touch the window buffer (like when repainting the window background), something tries to sync the window buffer surface with the GL context surface and blocks on GL flush completion.
We can work around that by moving our GL repaints away from setNeedsDisplay and drawRect. Then we'll no longer redraw the window background unnecessarily and we'll no longer block on anything.

So the site assumes that if .csstransforms3d is set then the browser must be either WebKit or implement unprefixed 3D transforms.
Unfortunately, that class _is_ set in a current nightly, because the site is using Modernizr, which looks for a ""MozPerspective"" property, which we now have as a result of the patches in bug 505115.",PROBLEM_CAUSE_IDENTIFICATION,0,FULL_TOKEN

Here is your explanation translated (in case it's what you want to translate) :
Donc, le site considère que si .csstransforms3d est défini, le navigateur doit être WebKit ou implémenter les transformations 3D sans préfixe.
Malheureusement, cette classe EST définie avec la nightly actuelle puisque le site utilise Modernizr, qui cherche la propriété ""MozPerspective"" qui, comme nous le savons, donne le résultat des patches du bug 505115.

No, it's ""now"".  As in, we did not use to have it, and now we do have it.
I suspect that just adding a -moz-transform:translate3d to that last CSS block from comment 2 and likewise for the other several places this selector pattern appears should help.  You should probably add the -o- and -ms- versions too.",POTENTIAL_SOLUTION_DESIGN,1,FULL_TOKEN

""...no point... Not much point..."", I'll probably be happy to read your english for a while as it shows me how to improve my own. :)

Not horribly unexpected, the issue is with pools.  More specifically, with pools and the repatcher.
For repatchable stub calls (well all calls, but specifically, repatchable calls) we generate the sequence
ldr r12, [pc, pool_dest]
ldr r8, [pc, pool_jaeger_stub_veneer]
blx r8
...
pool:
...
pool_dest:
.word function_to_call
pool_jaeger_stub_veneer
.word jaeger_stub_veneer
which will load the address of a function out of pool_dest, into register 12, then load the address of the jaeger stub veneer into r8, and call the jaeger stub veneer. The repatcher gets the address of |ldr r8, ...|, then looks back at the previous instruction, decodes enough of the instruction to find the address of pool_dest, and finally writes over the |.word function_to_call| with the new value.
In this case, however, immediately after emitting |ldr r12, [pc, pool_dest]|, we determined the pool needed to be flushed, and flushed the pool, thus the sequence we actually got was:
ldr r12, [pc, pool_dest]
b after_pool
pool1:
...
pool_dest:
.word function_to_call
after_pool
ldr r8, [pc, pool_jaeger_stub_veneer]
blx r8
...
pool2
pool_jaeger_stub_veneer
.word jaeger_stub_veneer
so when the instruction that the re-patcher gets is still |ldr r8, [pc,pool_jaeger_stub_veneer]|. However, the ""instruction"" before it is now .word function_to_call rather than |ldr r12, [pc, pool_dest]|.  This is why the assertion is thrown.  The result of calling the patcher on this is: we read the bottom 12 bits of the function that we're attempting to patch from, add it to the address of the patch (two before the actuall call to jaeger_stub_veneer), get a memory location, and write over that memory location with a single word of data that any possible attackers most likely won't get to control (We are writing over the value with the address of a C function).  More likely than not, the address that we write over will *not* be word aligned, whereas any instructions (or other data) that we generate will likely be word aligned, so it is likely going to write over parts of two different values.  I would say that this is in fact exploitable, but would be hard pressed to generate a reasonable exploit.",PROBLEM_REVIEW,0,FULL_TOKEN
696748,5,"I can think of two possible solutions:
1) rather than storing the address of the second instruction, store the address of the *first* instruction, so we'll be able to walk forwards and get to the other two, possibly following pool guards.
2) mark those three instructions as a no-pool zone.  no-pool zones have always felt like a hack.
I'll need to find out why we carry the address of the second instruction to begin with.",POTENTIAL_SOLUTION_DESIGN,1,FULL_TOKEN

700508,1,"Memory reporters have a path.  Many of them have segments that form part of a tree, e.g. the ""explicit"" tree.  Bug 653630 allowed non-leaf reporters, whereby you could have something like ""explicit/foo"" and ""explicit/foo/a"" and aboutMemory.js would add in ""explicit/foo/other"" which was ""explicit/foo"" - ""explicit/foo/a"".
This was necessary for the SQLite reporters, because SQLite provides a single reporter for its entire memory use, and then reporters for each of its connections, but we don't have a single list of those connections anywhere so we had to do the arithmetic in aboutMemory.js rather than creating an ""sqlite/other"" reporter.
Unfortunately, allowing non-leaf reporters made aboutMemory.js more complicated and I've been annoyed by it for ages.  Bug 700217 is the catalyst for me filing this bug.
The only hard part is dealing with the SQLite reporters.  One way would be to replace the ""storage/sqlite"" reporter with a ""storage/sqlite/other"" reporter, which would require the aforementioned list of all SQLite connections.  Probably not too hard.  A hacky alternative would be to special-case ""storage/sqlite"", making it the only allowed non-leaf reporter.  (Brendan has a philosophy that it's generally ok to have one exception to a rule, which I think is an interesting idea!)

I did this, it was easier than working out how to track all the SQLite connections.  aboutMemory.js's complexity didn't change much -- it no longer has to deal with non-leaf nodes, which is good, but it has to special case ""explicit/storage/sqlite"", which is bad.
GetExplicit is much simpler, though, and avoids the quadratic case.

Nit: Parallelism.  ""Non-leaf TreeNodes, *which* are just scaffolding""
What should never happen for ""explicit""?  Shouldn't you reverse this?  ""We
should always find a reporter when aTreeName == explicit, but some 'map' trees
might be missing"".  In fact, you could
  assert(aTreeName != 'explicit' || foundReporter).
Kind of a weird variable name...  I guess it's supposed to be like |aT|?  Maybe
|heapUnclassifiedNode| would be better?
Typo.
I'd add an explicit mention of the fact that non-leaf reporters other than
sqlite/other are not allowed.  (The sqlite/other special-case is now part of
our interface, so we might as well document it here.)

714547,7,"Yeah. Everything I've said has a giant asterisk next to it saying ""document.domain makes most of this not apply!"" We only realized how badly document.domain was broken at the end of compartments, so we hacked in a solution that mostly works.
Actually, it's my department!
Historically, security checks only happened when calling getters, when getting certain properties (such as __proto__ and .constructor) and when entering XPConnect (that is, calling C++ functions from JS). Therefore, if you had set document.domain on two documents, gotten some objects out of them and then reset document.domain, you'd have a bunch of objects that somewhat worked, but would occasionally throw exceptions depending on which properties were being accessed.
Right now, because we assume that you can't have a vanilla object cross-origin, some objects (such as arrays) will continue to work fine, but you won't be able to access DOM objects any more (since they no longer consider themselves to be same origin).
The plan going forward for this is that when we have compartment-per-global, we will be able to do brain transplants for all of the objects in the compartment that sets document.domain, properly revoking access to the old objects.

Array.isArray was added to the spec because it addresses a real problem authors face: that instanceof is insufficient for testing the kind (""class"") of an object.  We've supported and advocated its use for a year and a half now, particularly for the very case at issue here and in duplicate bugs.
I don't think I can call this a ""minor functional regression"".  That description is arguably accurate for this bug's symptoms outside of Array.isArray.  But Array.isArray not working in this way means that API is fundamentally broken.  Its *entire purpose* is to answer that question correctly; this mistake isn't an edge case.

Update libvpx to v1.0.0
khuey: You only need to review the build-system bits (configure.in and Makefile.in changes).
cpearce: If you need me to break out the series of patches we now apply into individual attachments to make reviewing them in bugzilla easier, I'm happy to do so.
Sorry for the delay on this. This update required an unusual amount of work to get things into decent shape.
The new MFQE post-processing filter in the decoder started using a number of variance functions from the encoder, but outside the existing run-time CPU detection framework (which was all still in the encoder structures, which we normally don't compile). This is fixed upstream, but that fix was done after the entire RTCD framework was rewritten. That rewrite is probably too invasive to backport to this release, and had at least one known issue that wasn't fixed until earlier this week, so I chose to move everything within the existing RTCD framework instead (see I256a37c6.patch and variance-invoke.patch; the latter is obsoleted by the new RTCD framework and shouldn't need to go upstream).
I'll work on getting textrels.patch (needed to keep native Fennec from crashing on startup) and compile_errors.patch upstream as well (I had pointed them at the latter before, but the problem has only gotten worse since then, so I'll be more proactive about it). Maybe I can rekindle their interest in solaris.patch, too, so we can stop carrying that one. stdint.patch should already be upstream, but didn't make the v1.0.0 release.",CODE_IMPLEMENTATION,1,90_PCT_MATCH

731836,1,"Currently, due to our driver blacklisting, less than 50% of users have WebGL working:
  http://people.mozilla.org/~bjacob/gfx_features_stats/
A good way to improve that is to use a software renderer as a fallback.
In the present bug, we're discussing only doing this as an add-on. But once we have that, the next step will be to have the browser automatically download it when it's needed. So really, we're aiming for a full automatic solution.
*** Part 0. Get started with Mozilla hacking ***
This page has useful tips to get started, especially for Graphics hacking (tools, how to get source code, etc):
  https://wiki.mozilla.org/Platform/GFX/Contribute
Code search tool:
  http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/
*** Part 1. Get Mesa llvmpipe up and running ***
Mesa is an open source OpenGL library.
  http://www.mesa3d.org
Mesa can use various renderers. Some are hardware-accelerated, some are software-only. The best software-only renderer is called 'llvmpipe' because it uses LLVM for compiling shaders.
 http://www.mesa3d.org/llvmpipe.html
This is available for x86 and x86-64 on Linux, Windows and Mac. Build instructions:
 http://www.mesa3d.org/install.html
IIUC, scons is the recommended way on Windows.
Your first step is to get a build of Mesa llvmpipe for your favorite OS. To be honest, the most interesting OS here is Windows, because that's where the largest proportion of users have outdated GPU drivers, but all OSes are interesting.
*** Part 2. Get Firefox to run WebGL with Mesa llvmpipe ***
Building Mesa llvmpipe should produce a OpenGL library that you could use as a drop-in replacement for the system OpenGL libraries. Notice that on Windows, to get Firefox to use OpenGL, you have to go to about:config and set these preferences:
  webgl.prefer-native-gl = true
  webgl.force-enabled = true
You can check in about:support, 'WebGL renderer', if llvmpipe is actually used.
Run the conformance tests to check that things are decently working:
  https://cvs.khronos.org/svn/repos/registry/trunk/public/webgl/sdk/tests/webgl-conformance-tests.html
Also, you can assess performance by first disabling compositing acceleration (we want to optimize for the case where hardware acceleration doesn't work, so better work in real conditions):
  layers.acceleration.disabled = true
and then play some WebGL demos such as
  http://webglsamples.googlecode.com/hg/aquarium/aquarium.html
*** Part 3. Get Firefox to dynamically switch to Mesa llvmpipe ***
Until now we haven't had to touch Mozilla code, but now we have to. It was nice to be able to test WebGL on llvmpipe, but for it to be practical, it must not require replacing system OpenGL libraries by llvmpipe, and Firefox must be able to decide at runtime whether to use llvmpipe.
Let's not automatically fall back to llvmpipe for now. Instead, let's introduce a new preference in about:config that allows to choose llvmpipe for WebGL rendering.
The file to edit, to add a new preference, is:
http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/tip/modules/libpref/src/init/all.js
Call it webgl.use-llvmpipe, boolean, default to false.
In the WebGL initialization code, where we choose our 'GL context provider' (e.g. WGL vs EGL vs GLX...). The problem is twofold. First, we want use-llvmpipe to override the OpenGL driver blacklist i.e. the same effect as webgl.force-enabled. Second, on Windows, switching to Mesa llvmpipe requires switching to WGL (the default is EGL) i.e. the same effect as webgl.prefer-native-gl.
So edit this file:
http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/tip/content/canvas/src/WebGLContext.cpp
Search for Preferences::GetBool in this file, in WebGLContext::SetDimensions, which is where we create the OpenGL context for a WebGL context.
Once this is done (so we're now using the correct GL context provider for llvmpipe and ignoring the blacklist) we can proceed to the code where we actually load the OpenGL library and create a OpenGL context. That code is in different files depending on the OS. If you can't test on all OSes, it's fine to only do yours.
Windows: http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/tip/gfx/gl/GLContextProviderWGL.cpp
Mac: http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/tip/gfx/gl/GLContextProviderCGL.mm
Linux: http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/tip/gfx/gl/GLContextProviderGLX.cpp
Look for where we're setting the filename of the library we're opening. For example, on Windows it's
  http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/1c3b291d0830/gfx/gl/GLContextProviderWGL.cpp#l141
There, you want to read the webgl.use-llvmpipe preference again (yes, that's not super efficient, if needed we'll optimize that later). Use again Preferences::GetBool; you might need to add a #include ""mozilla/Preferences.h"" for it.
The filename is up to you; it should probably be different from the system default (e.g. not opengl32.dll) otherwise AFAICS we won't be able to choose one over the other.
*** Part 4. Wrap this as a Firefox add-on ***
I'm not competent with that part. We'll have to find another mentor when we're there.
*** Next steps ***
Once we're there, we'll want to see how we can get Gecko to automatically download Mesa llvmpipe when needed. We don't want to ship it with the standard Firefox build, as that would inordinately increase the Firefox download size.",POTENTIAL_SOLUTION_DESIGN,1,80_PCT_MATCH
731836,2,"I volunteer as a mentor for part 4+.
That said, I'm not sure to understand what you meant by ""Wrap this as a Firefox add-on"" if ""this"" are the previous parts, modifying existing native built-in implementations, which is something an add-on cannot do afaik.
Otoh, the subsequent ""automatically download llvmpipe if needed"" would imho really fit as a feature of the add-on rather than of Gecko (the add-on possibly being bundled in Firefox at a later stage).
IMHO it could be nice (and perhaps even simpler/cleaner in the end) to expose a generic ""add-on aware"" mechanism to specify a fallback GL implementation at context creation time (ie. no 'llvmpipe' reference in Gecko, not even as a pref name).
An add-on could provide LLVMpipe fallback but another add-on could provide another alternative software implementation as easily (possibly Transgaming could even release a SwiftShader add-on).
The add-on would also have the possibility of forcing a reduced size drawing buffer as it sees fit.
It could work by implementing a simple WebGLContextProviderFallbackService XPCOM interface like :
interface nsIWebGLContextFallbackProviderService {
  registerFallbackProvider(in WebGLContextFallbackProvider provider);
  unregisterFallbackProvider(in WebGLContextFallbackProvider provider);
  [noscript] WebGLContextFallbackProvider tryFallbackProviders(in DOMCanvasElement canvas);
}
/* this is an interface declaration only, it's up to the fallback add-on(s) to implement this */ 
interface nsIWebGLContextFallbackProvider {
  bool canProvideFallbackForCanvas(in DOMCanvasElement canvas);
  readonly DOMString providerName;     // ""wgl"", ""cgl"", ""glx"" or ""egl""
  readonly DOMString nativeLibraryPath;// eg. ""c://win/system32/my_egl.dll""
  readonly DOMString glLibraryPath;    // eg. ""c://win/system32/my_gles_v2.dll""
  readonly long drawingBufferWidth;    // eg. same as canvas.width
  readonly long drawingBufferHeight;   // eg. same as canvas.height
}
tryFallbackProviders implementation:
1) for each registered WebGLContextFallbackProvider, in reverse order of registration:
  2) call canProvideFallbackForContext with the given canvas argument
  3) if the call returned true, break the loop at 1 and return the current WebGLContextFallbackProvider
4) return null
In GLContextProvider interface, append 2 optional string arguments nativeLibraryPath and glLibraryPath to CreateOffscreen().
static GLContextProvider::GetInstance(providerLibraryPath = nsnull, glLibraryPath = nsnull)
In setDimensions(), append the following steps when context creation failed :
1) call WebGLContextFallbackProviderService.tryFallbackProviders(canvas) and store the return value in local ""provider""
2) if ""provider"" is not null, attempt to create a context, using the GLContextProvider interface specified by provider.providerName (eg. GLContextProviderWGL if ""wgl"") and the provider desired attributes. eg:
''
gl::GLContextProviderWGL::CreateOffscreen(gfxIntSize(provider.drawingBufferWidth, drawingBufferHeight), format, provider.nativeLibraryPath, provider.glLibraryPath);

731836,3,"Indeed, I was a bit unclear. I think that parts 1--3 should ship directly in Gecko. What can't ship in Gecko, is llvmpipe itself, because that would be too big (I'm worried about the Firefox download size). So we would ship parts 1--3 in Gecko itself, and wrap llvmpipe in an add-on that also has the effect of turning on the webgl.use-llvmpipe preference. Does that make sense?

As discussed on IRC, I think we should always refer to it as 'Mesa LLVMpipe', not just 'LLVMpipe'. Both in the pref name and the variable.
Indeed:
 - llvmpipe alone doesn't give Mesa enough credit,
 - mesa alone isn't specific enough since on Linux, most people use Mesa with their GPU, just not with the llvmpipe driver.

We can do better/simpler than that, without hardcoding WGL here.
Just GLContextProvider will give you the default context provider on the current platform. On Windows, it gives you GLContextProviderWGL. We already do that below, but only after we try EGL which is what we do by default on Windows (ANGLE rendering uses the EGL path).
Just edit this part:

731836,20,"I've been tinkereing with building and using llvmpipe with firefox on Linux. I've not had any trouble building it against LLVM 3.0. I just built LLVM 3.0, put it in my $PATH and built Mesa 8.0.2 against it. Using LLVM 3.0 also fixes some rendering bugs I was seeing with LLVM 2.8.
Slightly off topic, and maybe something for another bug report, but, I've also hacked my version of Mesa to fast path glReadPixels. With Mesa 8.0.2 the developers significantly improved the performance of glReadPixels. Problem is, the performance boost for llvmpipe is for BGRA data only. Firefox seems to read RGBA data, so it doesn't benefit at all. I bodged the code to force a fast path for RGBA data. My patch regresses BRGA performance (and rendering) but boosts RGBA performance (on my machine) by up to 850%.

I have to say, I didn't know that we had all these global variables in this file (like gSharedWindow).
This makes it hard to find a solution that will really work, and will allow dynamic switching to/from llvmpipe.
Your solution seems like it only works as long as only one WGL library is in use at a given time (why else would there be a global variable named gCurrLib).
Let me propose that for the short term, we just require that only one WGL library will be used for the whole run of the application. So in the first context creation (maybe in WGLLibrary::EnsureInitialized or in some constructor), record the WGL library type (real opengl or mesa llvmpipe) and in subsequent calls, compare the new library type to the recorded one and fail context creation if they're different.
Indeed, the rationale is that if native OpenGL ever succeeds, there should be no reason to use llvmpipe, and if native OpenGL fails, we have no choice but to use llvmpipe.
Then, the better solution, that will allow dynamic switching between native OpenGL and llvmpipe, will consist in refactoring this GLContextProviderWGL.cpp file to get rid of these global variables.

So, after our conversations today (IRC + skype) and reading this patch, I understand a bit more than before --- sorry I've been a bit slow to understanding this: the added complexity to support dynamic switching is actually not that big, since the majority of that is just the changes to move global variables into members of the WGLLibrary singleton, which is a good change anyway. So, I agree again that dynamic switching is a good idea :-) sorry... this time I shouldn't change my opinion again anymore.
So we're very near r+ here, I would just like these changes:
 1. revert to allowing dynamic switching
 2. only read the llvmpipe preference in WebGL context creation, let every other place create OpenGL contexts with default flags (so, no LLVMpipe) regardless of the preference. Indeed, LLVMpipe is only really useful for WebGL. For Layers, using OpenGL layers with LLVMpipe won't be faster than BasicLayers. We will simply have to ensure that the interop between WebGL/LLVMpipe and BasicLayers works efficiently (i.e. we'll have to ensure that we read back the pixels in LLVMpipe's native format).
     -> bonus: this means that you won't have to deal anymore with reading preferences outside of the main thread.

The versions in AutoMounter are missing the TEMP_FAILURE_RETRY.
In fact, we should probably make these available somewhere in Gonk since they occur so frequently. we should factor these out into a common location.

V3 of the patch incorporates the reviews of previous versions.
- The remaining time is now separate from the charge level.
- I choose to rename 'GetCurrentBatteryCapacity' to 'GetCurrentBatteryCharge' instead of 'GetCurrentBatteryLevel'. This way the percentage value 'charge' is clearly distinguished from the dimension-less 'level'. Using type int for 'charge' makes the code a bit simpler.
- I also adapted the ReadSysFile functions, which simplifies the code a lot. Dave, I think there is a bug in ReadSysFile for strings. When you read 0 bytes, you access the byte before the string array when testing for '\n'. It's fixed in my copy.

IDLs
I'm sorry that I have more than minor nits on this IDL, despite the fact that
we went through it on the mailing list.  I hope you won't have to make too many
big changes.
Jonas, I'd appreciate your thoughts on a few comments below.
MPL2, please.
The filename should match the name of the interface.  Also, ""FM"", not ""Fm"", please.
I also think it would be better if we called this interface nsIDOMFMRadio.  For
example, it's nsIDOMScreen, not nsIDOMScreenManager.
Shouldn't this be part of the audio API?
Nit: ""Current frequency, in MHz"".
Nit: Why is this a float, while the frequency is a double?  I'd rather use
doubles everywhere, unless there's a reason not to.
Can we add the signal strength in dBm as well, if we have that available?
Nit: Please use javadoc-like formatting for this and all the other comments in the idl files:
 /**
  * Comment comment comment.
  */
 readonly attribute foo;
There's no such thing as a ""JSON object"" -- that's just an Object in Javascript.  :)
We need to figure out what's going on with these bands.  If the goal is
to support things other than FM radio, then we shouldn't call this
nsIDOMFMManager/nsIDOMFMRadio.
My instictint is to ignore AM, which I think we're unlikely to support due to
physical constraints (the antenna needs to be large).  Then we can spec this
attribute as follows:
""Returns the band ranges supported by this FM radio.  The return
value is a list of objects, each of which indicates the band's upper and lower
limits, in MHz.  For example:
       [ {lower: 87.5, upper: 108},
         {lower: 76,   upper: 90} ]
Also, if we expose all the supported bands on this object, then it doesn't make a lot of sense to me that you can't change the current band using this object.  At the very least, we need to add an attribute which indicates what is the current band.  But IMO, if you can't select a band using nsIDOMFMRadio, we shouldn't tease you with the list of available bands, and should only give you the upper and lower limits of the currently-selected band.
We also need to give the station interval, since that changes with different bands.
Jonas and Ray, what do you think?
onsignalstrength change, perhaps?
Also, could you please add a comment here indicating how we throttle these events?
onantennaavailablechange, or onantennastatechange?  Otherwise it sounds like we're changing the antenna itself.
It's weird to have one event which fires when the antenna is plugged/unplugged but then fire a different event 
We want to support addEventListener() for these too, which means that
nsIDOMFMRadio needs to inherit from nsIDOMEventTarget.
Nit: ""If the given frequency is outside the current band range"".
I don't think it's right to say that onerror is fired ""immediately"".  Surely
you have to wait until we spin the event loop, because otherwise the following
won't work:
  let req = setFrequency(0); // error, fires req.onerror
  req.onerror = function() { dump(""An error occurred""); };
  // The dump() is never run, because onerror was already fired.
What happens if you call seekDown/seekUp while a seek is running?
It's not wrong to put builtinclass here, but it's a little odd.  khuey says:
  Typically we've added builtinclass to interfaces where if JS implemented it,
  sg:crits (i.e., critical security bugs) would result.  But feel free to
  sprinkle it liberally.
I'd probably leave it off in this case, since nsIFMAdaptor /could/ be implemented in JS with no problems.
Could you please add a comment here indicating what this interface is for?  It took me a while to figure it out.  :)
nsIFMAdaptor, please, and change the filename to match.  But I'd prefer this matched the name of the DOM interface.  What do you think about calling them nsIDOMFMRadio and nsIFMRadio?

I think we have discussed on this in the email, AM might be covered in the future, and that's why the bandRanges object looks like: {""FM"": {""upper"": 108, ""lower"": 87.5}}.
And in v1, there is no plan to add an option to change the band in the Settings app,  so ""onbandchange"" is not introduced to the API in v1, and it is unnecessary to introduce the station interval either.

779500,19,"If that's the reason, we should make this a separate API.  It's not a lot more
work to make a separate API than it is to include it on the FM radio API.
If FM radio were accessible only to privileged content, then maybe I'd be OK
with a hack like this, but if we're exposing this to the world, then we should
not create bogus APIs because it's slightly easier.
But isn't this the proposed API?  I'm asking, why is the proposed API for
signal strength a float and not a double?
AM radio should not be part of the ""FM radio"" api.  If we really want to be
able to support AM in the future -- and I think that's unlikely to happen,
because AM antennas are quite large -- then we should rename this API to
""TunableRadio"" or something.  But I think designing for an unlikely eventuality
is likely a mistake.
If we want to support multiple bands then we should design bandRanges to let
you see multiple FM and multiple AM bands.  At the moment, you can only see one
FM and one AM band.  But if we're designing for future extensibility to AM, we
should also design for future extensibility to multiple FM bands, because the
latter is far more reasonable than the former.
But more to the point: We need some way for the app to know which is the
currently-selected band; apps shouldn't assume that there's only one band in
bandRanges, because that defeats the purpose.
So regardless of whether we're allowing multiple bands now or in the future, we
still need to have
  double upperFreq;
  double lowerFreq
  double channelFreqInterval;
or otherwise
  jsval currentBand;  /* {upper, lower, interval} */
so that you know what the current band is set to.  IMO, if we're not allowing
switching between bands, we should not expose bandRanges, because it's not
useful.
Why doesn't the FM radio app need the interval?  Are you expecting that the app
will have a hardcoded interval?  Or that it will always use seek()?  What if an
app wants to allow the user to manually tune the radio?
Okay, can you please document that we can never have multiple seeks going at
once, so cancelSeek cancels the one outstanding seek or otherwise fails?

Yeah, it's a consistency argument.  We don't need 52 bits of precision for
either signal strength or FM frequency, so neither of them /needs/ to be a
double.
But double is JavaScript's natural floating-point type (it does not have a
32-bit float, except as a typed array), so in the absence of any good reason to
use a float, I think we should use a double.
I think we're not talking about the same thing.  There are two separate things here.
  * ""The current band"", which indicates the parameters (AM/FM,
    frequency upper and lower bounds, and channel interval) that the radio is
    currently using.  There is only ever one current band.
  * ""The band ranges"", which indicates all possible values that the current
    band might be set to.
The FM app needs only ""the current band"" in order to show the dialier.  It does
not need a list of all band ranges that the FM chipset supports.
But apps implementing an FM radio cannot necessarily read settings.  The
settings API is not available to unprivileged web content (or even many apps).
If the FM app were able to read settings, then we would not need to expose ""the
current band"" to the FM app; we could define that information in the settings,
too.  In fact, we would not need the FM API at all; we could define everything
about this API in the settings.
That settles that, then.  :)
Ah, I remember this now.
As you discovered, nsIDOMEventTarget is a builtinclass.  That means that if
nsIDOMFMRadio inherits from nsIDOMEventTarget, you can't implement it in JS.
That's probably why nsIDOMWifiManager doesn't inherit from it.
But if you don't inherit from nsIDOMEventTarget, then you can't do
addEventListener on it.
In other words, you can't implement event targets in JS!
It's bad that nsIDOMWifiManager is not an event target, but I think it would be
worse if the FM radio was not an event target, because we're exposing it to all
of the web.  So I think you're going to have to rewrite the implementation of
nsIDOMFMRadio in C++.  I don't think we want to create a public interface where
you have to use the onX handlers.

Can we make the value here null if FM is not enabled?  That way there's no confusion, nor any contract that this API will remember things.

  readonly attribute double frequencyLowerBound;
  readonly attribute double frequencyUpperBound;
  readonly attribute double channelWidth;
If we have fm.availableBands at some later date, they can be {lowerBound, upperBound, width} objects, which would be fine.  We don't need to expose our current band data as an Object in order to make the future availableBands property make sense.
Perhaps we should have two methods
  DOMRequest disableRadio();
  DOMRequest enableRadio(in double frequency);
Otherwise, you have to enable the radio and then set the frequency.  But after you enable and before you set the frequency, you're in this weird state where the radio is ""on"" but not tuned.
What do you think?
What happens if I set the frequency to 87.6, when the min freq is 87.5 and the channel width is .2?
I'd guess that can't be an error, because we can't represent all fractions precisely as doubles. Even if I send 87.7, I might actually send 87.70000000000002.  In other words, we have to do some amount of rounding.
So I guess I have a question and a suggestion.  My suggestion is that we say that even if setFrequency(x) succeeds, it is not guaranteed that fm.frequency == x, because we may reduce the precision of the given frequency.
And my question is: Do you know if the radio can tune to halfway between a channel, or must it always tune to precisely one of the channels?  That is, should the user expect their given frequency to be rounded to a channel, or just rounded to something?  Whatever it is is fine, but we should document it.

  - if set the frequency with 88.06, the frequency will be rounded to 88.0
So it's for sure the frequency will be rounded by the FM HW, there may be problem with spacing type setting though.
IMO, the frequency should be rounded, depending on the band settings, for example:

We say ""signal strength /changes/"", instead of ""signal strength /is changed/"", because the signal strength is beyond anyone's direct control.  By analogy, we'd say ""the weather changes"", not ""the weather is changed"" (unless someone has a weather machine!).
Also, you mentioned earlier that this event is throttled -- can you explain how, here?
s!Power on/off the FM device!Power the FM radio on/off!
In general, we should refer to events as ""powerchange"", rather than ""onpowerchange"".  ""powerchange"" is the name of the event, and ""onpowerchange"" is the name of the attribute on the FM radio which is tied to the ""powerchange"" event.
Also, there's also no onpowerchanged event.
This is a traditional comma splice; the two things separated by a comma are both independent clauses.  You can fix this by either adding a conjunction (e.g. "", and""), using a semicolon instead of the comma, or splitting the sentence in two.  In this case, I think the latter is the best option:
  Power the FM radio on/off.  The powerchange event will be fired if this
  request completes successfully.
I don't think we need to explain when onsuccess and onerror are fired; that's pretty clear from context.
I presume the app can listen to the frequencychange event or alternatively listen to request.onsuccess, right?

I'm not wed to a specific way of accomplishing this, but I think this is an important design consideration.
It basically means that if we do
  setTimeout(function() { alert('Radio about to be enabled.'); }, 0);
  fmRadio.setEnabled(true);
  ...
that the alert will show before the radio starts playing.  The setTimeout will fire some time after you've returned from all the code you're currently running.
When whatever JS code you're running finishes, the browser looks at the list of pending tasks (e.g. setTimeouts, onclick handlers, whatever) and runs one.  The code which does this is called the ""event loop"", and we say the event loop ""spins"" when it completes once.  If that makes any sense.
Okay.
I think the telephony property is bogus too, but I also think it's not as bad as putting speakerEnabled on the FM interface, because telephony will not be exposed to the vast majority of pages, while webFM will be available to every page on the web.  As a result, we will have much more difficulty removing speakerEnabled from the FM interface than we would removing it from the telephony interface.
I don't understand what is the motivation for putting speakerEnabled on the FM interface.  Surely if the FM radio app cares about whether the speaker is enabled, the MP3 player app also cares, right?  But we agree the MP3 player app shouldn't have to look at the FM radio API to determine whether the speaker is on?",SOLUTION_REVIEW,1,FULL_TOKEN
779500,51,"""setEnabled"" is an async method, when you called ""mozFMRadio.setEnabled(true)"", the enabling FM action will be executed in one thread or process which is obviously different from the thread/process which will execute the ""event loop"" (maybe my understanding is totally wrong), then i don't understand how to prevent ""setEnabled is guaranteed not to take effect until we spin the event loop"". 
So there should be an API to control the audio routing which will be exposed to the vast majority of pages, right?
If yes, what i can imagine, the API will not be specific used for FM audio, it will effect not only the FM app but also other apps which play sounds., and obviously it's not planned in V1 and even V2.
The B2G is designed to enable the speaker automatically when the headset is unplugged, and change it back when the user plugged the headset, it's OK for the MP3 player or video player, but for the FM, the headset is the antenna, if you unplugged the headset, the sound will become noise, so the FM app need such a interface to enable speaker without unplugging the headset.",POTENTIAL_SOLUTION_DESIGN,1,FULL_TEXT
779500,52,"I have to say i am totally confused.
If we keep seperating the ""setEnable""(not tuned to some frequency automatically) and ""setFrequency"", the FM will stay quiet after it is enabled and before we tuned it, and the state will be enabled-but-not-tuned which you feel so weird, if we want to kill such a ""weird"" state, the only thing we can do is combining them into one atom action, i.e. enableRadio(frequency) you proposed, and the app will have to set a frequency which is also a *random* number to the end user when enabling the FM.",POTENTIAL_SOLUTION_DESIGN,1,FULL_TEXT
779500,53,"No, because I do not think that a webpage should be able to pipe audio out of the phone's speaker.  That's another good reason not to put speakerEnabled on the FM radio interface.
I think the FM radio should immediately shut itself off when you unplug the headset (which functions as the antenna).  Playing static through the phone's external speaker when the headset is disconnected is not useful in any way.
Then the only use-case for speakerEnabled that Ray and I were able to come up with on IRC is: I want to listen to the FM radio on my phone's speakers, but I have to leave the headphones plugged in because they function as the radio's antenna, and B2G (currently) doesn't have any way for me to direct audio to the external speaker except by unplugging the headphones.
I don't feel like this is a core FM radio use-case.  Even if it's a blocker, I think we should figure it out in a follow-up bug, so as to reduce the scope of this bug and land it sooner.  We can argue about what interface the relevant APIs should live on in that bug.",SOLUTION_REVIEW,1,FULL_TOKEN

Here's the first part of the review.  It covers everything except the JS bits.  I'm working on the JS code now.
I'm sorry again this took so long.  The next round should go faster.
""The addEventListener, removeEventListener, and dispatchEvent methods below are
a temporary hack, which will be removed once nsIDOMFMRadio can inherit from
nsIJSDOMEventTarget.  See bug 731746.""
(The main problem here is that we use ""this"" when we mean ""these"".)
Does this file not work if you don't include these to files?  It's not clear
why you need them.
Please add a brief comment here explaining what nsIFMRadio is for.
Please indicate what the units are here.  (I don't see why this shouldn't be a
double like nsIDOMFMRadio.)
Please match nsIDOMFMRadio by making signalStrength a double.
Please add a comment explaining what settings are expected.
In fact, we really should create a new interface (e.g. nsIFMRadioSettings) and
use that as the argument type here.
Relying on FM_RADIO_SEEK_DIRECTION_{UP,DOWN} is problematic here, because
callers from JS don't have access to those constants.
Instead, you should add constants to this IDL file, like:
      const long SEEK_DIRECTION_UP = 0;
      const long SEEK_DIRECTION_DOWN = 1;
(Notice that these are |long|'s, that is, int32's.  I don't think it makes
sense to use a short here; this is effectively an enum, and we use XPIDL |long|
for that.)
Again, switch this to nsIFMRadioSettings, so that if I called this from C++, I
wouldn't have to unpack a mysterious jsval.
Again, indicate what the units are on frequency, and consider using a double
here (unless there's a good reason not to?).
These should all be nsIRunnable.  That will give you a strongly-typed callback
function, which is what you're going for here, I think.  (In other words, if
you used nsIRunnable here, you wouldn't have to change any of the JS code which
calls this interface.)
It looks like FM radio support is guarded by MOZ_B2G_FM, but this JSM is
included on all B2G builds.  Should you add a check here that MOZ_B2G_FM is
set?
We never put |using namespace| inside a header file.  That causes serious
breakage, because it means that every header file which is included below this
one also |uses namespace mozilla::hal|, which effectively puts mozilla::hal
into the global namespace!
This is defined in hal/HalTypes.h, which is included above.  Do you need this here?
This comment is not adding anything; please remove it.
Fix spacing, please.  (Align everything to the first |public| above.)
       Dispatch a trusted, non-cancellable, not-bubbling event to ourself.
int32_t, or uint32_t, but almost never raw |int|.
But it looks like this should actually have the type hal::SwitchState.
Please add a comment indicating what this is the status of, and rename the
variable to something more meaningful than |mStatus|.
Why are these protected and not private?  Does someone inherit from this class?
These are virtual methods, no?  Notify(SwitchEvent&) comes from SwitchObserver,
and Notify(FMRadioOperationInformation&) comes from FMRadioObserver.  Both
SwitchObserver and FMRadioObserver are instances of mozilla::Observer, defined
in xpcom/glue/Observer.h.
In that case, these need to be marked as virtual.  Also, please put them up
with the other public methods.
A bunch of things will be changing in this file, per my comments in the IDL.  I
haven't commented on them further here.
As far as I can tell, these log statements are the only android-only feature of
this file.  Please guard them with an ifdef.  (You can just define LOG to do
nothing if we're not on Android.)
The right solution would be to use prlog, but that's kind of a pain to use in
b2g.  We have a pretty bad logging story. :(
You use these only once, and the macros aren't any shorter than what they're
replacing, so I'd inline the macros, if it was me.  Whatever you prefer is fine.
This comment isn't adding anything; please remove.
We format this like:
FMRadio::FMRadio()
  : mStatus(1)
  , mHasInternalAntenna(false)
We use NS_FAILED instead of !NS_SUCCEEDED and format this like
    if (NS_FAILED(Preferences::GetBool(DOM_FM_ANTENNA_INTERNAL_PREF,
                                       &mHasInternalAntenna)) ||
        !mHasInternalAntenna) {
But even better, I think, would be to do
    mHasInternalAntenna = Preferences::GetBool(""dom.fm.antenna.internal"",
                                               /* default = */ false);
    if (mHasInternalAntenna) {
      LOG(""We have an internal antenna."");
    } else {
      ...
    }
Please do
    if (...) {
(We almost never put the brace for an if statement on the next line.)
Gecko style is to brace all if/else statements.
Also, when you switch mStatus to the |SwitchState| type, please use
SWITCH_STATE_{ON,OFF}, not ""0"", here and elsewhere.
Nit: This is a comma splice.  Replace the comma with a period.
But I also don't understand this comment; the signal strength is [0-100], but
it can be bigger than 100?  Perhaps you could elaborate a bit in the comment.
Nit: how about
    *aSignalStrength = NS_MIN(signalStrength, 100) / 100.0;
blean
Nit: |const JS::Value& settings|.  But this whole thing is going to change
anyway, per the comments on the IDL.
|oldStatus| would be more idiomatic.
Nit: Please do
    event->InitEvent(aEventName, /* bubbles = */ false, /* cancelable = */ false);
Again, it's not clear to me why this guy is B2G only.",CODE_REVIEW,0,90_PCT_MATCH
779500,86,"TBH, it's not clear to me that we're winning anything by using JS here.  We
shouldn't rewrite this whole thing in C++ right now, but I think we should
start on that project once we land this and shake out the first round of bugs.
We'll get increased correctness, which is great, but I think the result may
also be simpler in a lot of ways.  Currently, the control flow is as follows:
  webpage (JS) -> nsIDOMFMRadio (JS) -> FMRadioService (JS) ->
    nsIFMRadio (C++) -> HAL (C++) -> hardware
but if nsIDOMFMRadio were implemented in C++, we could simplify this to
  webpage (JS) -> nsIDOMFMRadio (C++) -> HAL (C++) -> hardware
I think that would be a significant improvement.  What do you think?
I think it would be better to call this file ""DOMFMRadioChild.js"" and to call
FMRadioService.jsm ""DOMFMRadioParent.jsm"".  Then we don't have to guess about
what code lives in which process.
I don't use emacs, but shouldn't this be ""Mode: JavaScript""?
Please take out autoindent; that's an editing pref, not a formatting pref!
(Where do we get these bizarre modelines from?)
Why is getAntennaState in this list?
(I think this whole idiom that DOMRequestIpcHelper has developed is pretty
bogus; you shouldn't list twice each of the events that you want to listen to,
because that's just asking for a mistake.  But that's not your bug to fix
here.)
_fireSignalStrengthChangeEvent, please.
_fireAntennaAvailableChangeEvent, please.
What happens if takeRequest fails?
s/FM/FM radio
s/FM/FM radio
s/FM/FM radio
How about ""FM radio seek-up failed"".
Suggest something like ""FM radio seek-down failed.""
_call calls _checkPermission(), but everyone who calls _call() also calls
_checkPermission().
Except this is a lie; we're faking it right now.  So please indicate that.
You're not using the wantsUntrusted field, so you should omit it.
Just set this in the constructor so you don't have to check it everywhere.
Also, this._eventListenersByType would be a better name than _eventTypes.
We're inconsistent about how we name these string constants.  Here they're
capitals, like a C++ macro.  But then we have kMozSettingsChangedObserverTopic.
I don't care what you do, so long as you're consistent.
Also, ""spaceType"" is not a good name for the setting.  ""fm.channelInterval""
would be better.  ""fmRadio.cannelInterval"" would be even better.  :)
We're going to move these onto the nsIFMRadio interface, which will be an
improvement.
It's not clear to me why we should have constants like this when we could have
const VALID_CHANNEL_INTERVALS = [200, 100, 50]; // KHz
let _currentInterval = ...; // _currentInterval is either 200, 100, or 50.
But in any case, please call these ""CHANNEL_INTERVAL"" or ""INTERVAL"", but not
""SPACE_TYPE"".
Do you need ctypes here?
Please indent this as

                                     ""nsISettingsService"");
It looks like you intend to pass the frequency to _seekingCallback, but you
don't here.  I'm not sure, but is the right thing to pass a bool instead of -1?
Seems like you don't miss not having the frequency in the callback.
s/an negative/a negative/
s/callback/the callback/
s/fails/failed/
Also, please wrap this line and the other long comments in this patch.
s/, need to update current frequency/, so we need to update the current frequency./
We're calling |space| the |interval|, right?
Please add an example here for what happens when we pass an out-of-range value.
Also, probably better to use values in KHz rather than MHz in your example,
since that's what the function deals with.
Don't call this ""roundedPart"", because it's not rounded yet.  Either shove
|freq - lower| into the line below, or call this something else.
|_initialized|
_currentInterval.
Why do you initialize _currentBand and _currentSpaceType to actual values,
instead of null?  We shouldn't use these values until we get them from the FM
radio, right?
s/available currently/currently available
It's confusing that we use some global variables and functions and some class
variables and functions.
Can we make all the variables and functions live on the class, please?
We hard-code some observer message names but not others, which is
inconsistent.  I have no problem hard-coding them all.
It doesn't matter much, but for the sake of cleanliness and not encouraging
others to write bad code, please create one lock and get both settings.
""Initialized"", please.
When does this get called?  And why is this the right reaction to an error?
We don't need to inform hal that the band has changed?
Similarly, we don't need to inform hal here?  I guess hal is also listening to
the settings notifications?
Here and elsewhere, you could simplify this by doing
     let signalStrength = FMRadio.signalStrength;
     if (signalStrength != _currentSignalStrength) {
       _currentSignalStrength = signalStrength;
       pmm.broadcastAsyncMessage(...);
     }
I think that more clearly expresses your intent.
Passing a callback function here doesn't make much sense, since you always call
the callback synchronously!
It would make more sense to return true/false, I think.
Should _updatePowerState call _startSignalChecking/_stopSignalChecking, as
appropriate?  That would eliminate a class of possible bugs.
Also, it sounds like _updatePowerState should call _updateFrequency when we
transition to the |on| state?
Please make this interval value (2000) a pref.
When this._signalCheckingInterval is undefined, it != null, so we'll do this if
statement, even though you don't want us to.
A simple fix would be to initialize this._signalCheckingInterval to null in the
constructor.
I'd prefer that the large bodies in this case statement be broken out into
separate methods.
Surely you mean parseInt(msg.data) * 1000!
But if this is working as-is, it sounds like you don't need the parseInt at
all?
If you break this out into a separate method, then you can simply return here.  We prefer
  if (...) {
    ...
    return;
  }
  ...
to 
  if (...) {
    ...
  } else {
    ...
  }
in Gecko.
Doesn't this have the race condition we discussed much earlier, where the radio
is enabled and set to some random frequency, and only later set to the correct
frequency?
s/seeking currently/currently seeking
Same parseInt question here.
s/ranges/range
Also, we're not really doing ""return false"" so much as ""indicate that the
request failed.""
s/completes/completed
Again, seems like the callback to seekStation should accept a boolean, since it
doesn't care about the exact frequency.
If it so happens that the seek completes and the frequency didn't change
(perhaps because the frequency was manually changed during the seek, maybe for
some other reason), then we'll never fire success or failure on the DOM
request!  That's no good.
I'd feel better if seekUp and seekDown were implemented by one method.
Missing semicolon after the close paren.
It's not clear to me why you only want to send the DOMFMRadio::cancelSeek
message when updateFrequency changes the frequency (the callback is not invoked
when we don't change the frequency)!
Most of these changes are cosmetic; this patch is pretty good!  Although one of

These are comments on the C++ bits.  I'm working on the JS bits.
Please let me know in what form you'd prefer to get these English nits.  I'm
happy to rewrite sentences, to provide explanations on points of grammar, or
both, whatever you feel is most helpful.  My goal is to help you, not to be
annoying or unhelpfully pedantic, so if I'm not accomplishing my goal, please
let me know.
I'm sorry to nit, but this still has a few problems.
We need a preposition (""from"", in this case) between ""inheriting"" and
""nsIJSDOMEventTarget"".
It's not clear what ""these"" are.  It would be helpful if you'd explicitly list
the relevant methods.
You also need some kind of connector after the first comma (""hacks, /which/
will be removed"", or ""hacks; these will be removed"").
The second comma creates a comma splice; it should instead begin a new
sentence.
I'd also like a period at the end of the sentence.
We decided to call this the channelInterval?
If you want to be fancy, you could put ""[infallible]"" in front of ""attribute"".
That would let you do
  nsCOMPtr<nsIFMRadioSettings> settings;
  int32_t lowerLimit = settings->GetLowerLimit();
s/,/;/.  Otherwise this is great.
* s/in JS component/as a JS component/
* ""we need such an interface to be accessed in JS component and JS module""
  I'm not sure what you mean, but maybe it should be ""it can't access our C++
  hardware interface directly; instead it must go through this interface.""
* "", do not confuse it with the WEbFM DOM interface(nsIDOMFMRadio).""
  This is a comma splice, but it's corrected if you take the suggestion above.
  It's not clear what ""it"" refers to here.  It would be better to say ""Do not
  confuse /this interface/"".
  Space before the open parenthesis.
s/will be/is
(I have no idea what rule explains why we use the present tense for the first
part of this conditional and the future tense for the second part.)
I still don't get why we expose the frequency in KHz here and in MHz in the DOM
interface, but it's not a big deal.
s/plugged/plugged in/
(You can think of ""plugged in"" as a transitive verb.  Compare ""My tub is no
longer leaking; the hole is plugged,"" and ""I plugged in my antenna."")
s/by giving settings/with the given settings/
Do you still need the jscontext?
Seek to the next available channel (up or down).
Get the current settings.
Do you still need the jscontext?
Set the frequency in KHz
""state /is/ changed"", or ""state changes"".
Clearer would be ""Fired when the antenna goes from plugged in to unplugged (or
vice versa).""
s/the/a
The ""ns"" prefix is what we used before we had namespaces (and what we use now
in places where we don't have namespaces, like interfaces).
I'd be OK if this class lived in the top-level namespace.  Otherwise, if you
rename it to FMRadioSettings and leave it in mozilla::dom::fm that works too.
Please rename ""spaceType"" here and elsewhere.
I think mHeadphoneState and mHeadphoneObserver (or mHeadphoneSwitchState and
mHeadphoneSwitchObserver) would be better names here.  There are lots of
switches and observers you might otherwise have.
When you remove the nsAutoPtr below, you can remove this include, too.
Looks like you missed my earlier comment about this hunk:
Please indent ""/* default = */ false"" so it's the ""D"" in
DOM_FM_ANTENNA_INTERNAL_PREF.
You could change this to
  info.upperLimit() = settings->GetUpperLimit();
if you made this attribute [infallible].
nsRefPtr, not nsAutoPtr.
This is actually quite important, and I'm surprised it's not causing crashes.
nsAutoPtr does not call AddRef() on its member.  So that means that *_retval
has a refcount of 0, while the caller of this function expects it to have a
refcount of 1.  Which means we're likely to run into a use-after-free crash
here.",CODE_REVIEW,0,FULL_TOKEN

I don't think you meant to add this newline.
Part of the benefit of pulling these chunks into their own functions was that
""it would let you do early returns instead of these long |else| clauses.""  That
is, you could do here
  if (...) { 
    sendMessage(...);
    return;

It's not particularly important, but this is a common point of style in Gecko,
so you might as well familiarize yourself with it.  :)
Um...I have no idea where this BTDEBUG thing came from, but it's no good.
You're just defining LOG to printf for non-gonk systems.
A simple fix that I would be OK with is
#else
//#define LOG(args...) printf(args);
#define LOG(args...)
#endif
A better fix would be to use prlog.  See e.g. dom/ipc/ProcessPriorityManager.cpp.
See bug 749053 comment 111 -- apparently we /are/ getting dB's from the radio,
not a magic value between 1-100.  :)
Maybe the solution will be for hal to give us a value in dB, and then we'll
translate it into a value 0-5 here.  I'm not quite sure yet, but stay tuned, I
guess.
Oh no, I wasn't clear at all!  It should be ""If the WebFM API /is/ re-written

If we did 0-5, it's not clear how to correctly convert dBm into that scale.  At best, I guess we'd listen to the radio under different conditions and qualitatively rate how good it sounds.  Then we could correlate these qualitative measurements with the signal strength in dBm.
If otoh we spit out dBm, then the FM radio app author is going to have to do this experiment him or herself, if she wants to show a meaningful signal strength indicator to the user.
OTOH, the app may be interested in the real signal strength, instead of our arbitrary number.  And it will be hard to spec our arbitrary scale in a meaningful way.
My gut feeling is that we should just report raw dBm, since that's a meaningful number.  We can always add a 0-5 (or whatever) scale if necessary.  And then we should make it a priority after landing this bug to get rid of that broadcast I mentioned earlier, since as written, it looks like we're going to broadcast the FM radio signal strength to all processes every 2 seconds (since I imagine the dBm value will be different every time we read it, if only by a small amount).

779500,148,"This is a nit, but cell phones contain many radios (e.g. fm, gsm, wifi, bluetooth, nfc).  The WebFM API provides access to a device's /FM radio/.  I might additionally say in the introduction what you can do using the WebFM interface: ""This interface lets you turn the FM radio on and off and tune it to different stations.""
We're missing the channelWidth attribute.
I think this unfairly singles out the |frequency| attribute here in a way which may cause confusion.
Reading /any/ attribute in JS is a synchronous operation.  There is no such thing as an asynchronous attribute in JavaScript.
In general we care about synchronicity when it can cause disk I/O, because that's very slow.  That's why we don't like localStorage, for example.
It's true that reading the |frequency| attribute causes a synchronous call up to the parent process.  But as it turns out, we do a sync operation when reading all of the other attributes, as well.  The parent process does no I/O upon receiving one of these messages.
So either all of the attributes deserve a warning, or none of them does.  The issue isn't that a synchronous operation occurs, because that's how attributes work, but rather that we wait on a synchronous IPC message.  This isn't free, but it's a lot cheaper than sync I/O, so I'm not sure we want devs to be particularly scared of this.
Certainly you shouldn't expect getting the frequency (or any of the other attributes) to be fast, however.
Perhaps ""down to which""?  Really, this isn't sufficiently clear.  For example, can I manually set the FM radio frequency outside this bound?
What are the return values of these methods?  I think they return DOM requests, but we don't say so.

Sorry for not pointing this out in comments,
in STK spec(TS 11.14), Location Information TLV will be used in several places, proactive command, terminal response, and even call control envelope command(Bug 791939). So finally I move those members of locationInfo out of MozStkLocationEvent and make it MozLocationInfo. So this object could be reused in other places.
Sounds good, I'll make it

Great. I think it makes sense to split bug 833834, because we can land the patch in this bug for B2G 1.0 (I hope), whereas the changes in bug 833834 shouldn't be needed for B2G because B2G 1.0 won't have any old data without security-info if this lands before 1.0 is frozen.
I hope we can land the patch on central soon so that Lee can test it out to make sure it solves the problem he reported.

Bug caused by (feature/regressing bug #): long-existing bug
User impact if declined: Users will see a scary broken lock icon in the B2G browser (not just a harmless-looking globe like in desktop Firefox) for any site that uses AppCache.
Testing completed: None yet. We should bake this on central for a few days.
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): From a correctness/stability standpoint, this patch is very low risk, as we already use the same logic in the regular (not offline) cache. However, there may be some negative performance impact, since we're writing and reading an extra metdata element from the cache, and we know that I/O in the offline cache is prone to performance issues.

respectively, they both crash at:
    mTouchListenerTimeoutTask->Cancel();
Are we hitting a race-condition problem? Since both Cancel() and ~RunnableMethod() in class RunnableMethod call ReleaseCallee(), which is obviously not thread safe:
  void ReleaseCallee() {
    if (obj_) {
      RunnableMethodTraits<T>::ReleaseCallee(obj_);
      obj_ = NULL;
    }  
  }",PROBLEM_REVIEW,0,FULL_TOKEN
833964,18,"If I understand correctly, all accesses to mTouchListenerTimeoutTask happen on the controller/UI thread. So there shouldn't be a threading-related race condition here.
I don't see how we'd crash here though. mTouchListenerTimeoutTask should always be null or a valid pointer...",PROBLEM_REVIEW,0,FULL_TOKEN
833964,19,"So AFAICT the actual CancelableTask object pointed to mTouchListenerTimeoutTask is created in NewRunnableMethod (either at line 235 or line 267) and is deleted by the message loop code, I think around [1]. This means that once the task finished executing (i.e. the TimeoutTouchListeners method finishes), the pointer mTouchListenerTimeoutTask is pointing to garbage if it hasn't been nulled out explicitly. This could happen if, for example, the early-exit condition at the top of ContentReceivedTouch gets hit when TimeoutTouchListeners gets called. I don't know if there that early-exit condition  is guaranteed to never hit when being called through TimeoutTouchListeners but I don't think it is.
So, in a nutshell:
- mTouchListenerTimeoutTask is assigned and TimeoutTouchListeners is queued as a delayed task
- TimeoutTouchListeners runs
- The call to ContentReceivedTouch from TimeoutTouchListeners does an early exit at the top
- The message loop deletes the object pointed to by mTouchListenerTimeoutTask since it's done
- Some time later (could be much later, since mTouchListenerTimeoutTask is never re-assigned when non-null, except in ContentReceivedTouch), content calls into ContentReceivedTouch
- This time the early exit doesn't get hit
- Since mTouchListenerTimeoutTask is non-null, calling ->Cancel() on it goes boom.
In terms of fixing it, I see two options: one is to move the mTouchListenerTimeoutTask cancellation/nulling to the top of the method, before the early exit. I don't know if this will have other side-effects because I don't know what that check is doing exactly. The second option, much safer, is to just set mTouchListenerTimeoutTask to null in TimeoutTouchListeners(). We know the only place that function gets called is from the task, and once it's done, the task will be destroyed, so we might as well null out the pointer to it.

fuzzing material
Linux64 and OSX64 are done (except for the bugs, of course), so we are ready for fuzzing.  You should be able to pull http://hg.mozilla.org/users/lwagner_mozilla.com/odinmonkey/ and build.  A threadsafe shell would be useful since it allows more realistic operation-callback testing (just add a 'timeout(X)' call at the beginning and the watchdog thread will start firing interrupts every 1/10 of a second).
Attached is the Emscripten benchmark suite; just run each file individually from the shell (no args).  You should see ""warning: Successfully compiled asm.js code"" printed to the console.
A few notes/ideas for fuzzing:
 - It would be good to direct mutations to *inside* function containing the ""use asm"" directive.
 - Some of the benchmarks are tiny (corrections, memopsnjn, primes, copy) and short-running, so it would be fruitful to inject probably-valid asm.js into these scripts to see if you can get a crash or divergent behavior (compared to running either on a trunk shell or an odin shell with the ""use asm"" directive removed).  Note: different recursion limits are expected.
 - Other benchmarks are quite large (bullet.js, fannkuch.js, zlib) and take longer to run (esp if the code doesn't asm.js-type-check; several of these benchmarks are 5-10x slower w/o odin).  However, they compile relatively quickly (<1s) so these would be good files to mutate randomly to test for errors in the typechecker/compiler.  If you set warnings-as-errors (options(""werror"") toggles this option), you'll get a clean exception when compilation succeeds/fails and not have to wait for the actual script to run.
Let me know if you have any problems or ideas.  Alon said he started looking at Csmith and it's already caught an Emscripten bug; I think he'll turn the guns on Odin after he gets out from under the MWC work.",CODE_IMPLEMENTATION,1,FULL_TOKEN
840284,12,"Can you elaborate on how to use timeout() for fuzzing?  Should I just have the fuzzer call ""timeout(1800)"" sometimes?  Or do you want something like bug 831046?",QUESTION,0,FULL_TOKEN
840284,13,"Sure.  In bug 842411, I changed the threadsafe shell so that, when you call ""timeout(X)"", the watchdog thread will JS_TriggerOperationCallback every 10th of a second.  Before X seconds have elapsed, the operation callback will return ""true"", allowing execution to continue.
That'd work.  An improvement would be to add a parameter that lets you configure how often the interrupt occurs.  I was using 10,000 times a second earlier to really stress the Odin path.",POTENTIAL_SOLUTION_DESIGN,1,FULL_TOKEN
840284,14,"I'll do that, but I'm worried the testcases will depend on timing, so they won't get reduced / bisected (and they might get lost altogether).  Please fix bug 831046 :)",REQUIREMENT,0,FULL_TOKEN

Steps to reproduce:
The Byte Order Marker (a.k.a ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE) at U+FEFF is listed as a white-space character in ECMAScript 5 (chapter 7.2). String.prototype.trim() will remove it from both ends, as expected, but \s in regular expressions doesn't match it:
a) ""x\uFEFF"".trim()
b) /\s/.test(""\uFEFF"")
Actual results:
a) ""x""
b) false
Expected results:
\s should match the BOM.
On the other hand, if there is a specific reason why the BOM should not be considered as white space, trim() should follow suit and leave it intact (same goes for trimLeft() and trimRight()).
Current versions of Opera and Chromium behave as expected (can't test IE, sorry).",POTENTIAL_SOLUTION_DESIGN,1,FULL_TEXT

Review of attachment 8365135:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
I can see that this patch probably removes the crash, but it still seems we have an underlying bug that we're not dealing with yet?
The issue here is that mActiveChannel is somehow not a nsIParentRedirectingChannel (in other words, it's not an HttpChannelParent--nothing else implements it AFAICT).  HttpChannelParentListener is *always* created with an initial mActiveListener == HttpChannelParent, and the only way that can change is in OnRedirectResult, if we're redirected to FTP (that's the only case so far, right).
That can happen, of course--but then how exactly does an HttpChannelParentListener with a FTPChannelParent mActiveListener ever run across AsyncOnChannelRedirect and/or OnRedirectResult again?  FTP doesn't do redirects.  
So it seems to me that we're getting an ""extra"" call to OnRedirectResult here.  The mostly likely cause could be that we accidentally have 2 AutoRedirectVetoNotifier's on the stack somehow?  The nsHttpChannel code here is not easy to follow--seems like we could maybe try to do something stupid like add a nsHttpChannel.mHasHadVetoNotifier member variable, set it when we use an AutoRedirectVetoNotifier, and ASSERT that it's false?  Then maybe we can catch the stack trace if we somehow call OnRedirectResult twice.
Maybe I'm totally wrong here--but I can't think of how else OnRedirectResult is getting called when mActiveChannel isn't an HTTP channel.
If we somehow can't figure this out, or there's a valid reason why mActiveChannel could be something else here, I'm ok with this patch.
And it looks like bug 904559 is the same thing, except we're seeing AsyncOnChannelRedirect() get called, which seems even stranger--how can it get called again after we've switched mActiveChannel to an FTP channel?
BTW there are two asserts that you'd need to remove for this patch--one in AsyncOnChannelRedirect and one in OnRedirectResult.",CODE_REVIEW,0,FULL_TOKEN
904571,9,"I think extensions may override http channel implementation and hence the active channel is not our nsHttpChannel.

904571,10,"There is a potential for foreign (unknown) code be called while AutoRedirectVetoNotifier is on stack.  So it's actually not possible to say whether it can happen to be multiple times on the stack or not.  I think we can easily use mRedirectChannel of the channel to indicate whether we have called OnRedirectResult or not.  ~AutoRedirectVetoNotifier drops it from the channel (I've added an assert to check it's always non-null there and xpcshell tests that cover all codepaths for this class).  But a flag might be more reliable and also we'd have more control over the behavior...

There are builds between 9/24 and 12/11 where it is really difficult to get a repro and instead the Browser tab will need to be reloaded since the webpage becomes unresponsive many times.
I am making the window be between 9/23 and 9/24 since that is when it looks to have become and OOM issue which is what this bug is about. If the crash is considered relevant to this bug, then it occurred on the first 1.3 build from 9/19.

947523,42,Well that's not good. Seems like a sub-apzc bug.,CLARIFICATION,0,FULL_TEXT
947523,43,"So part of the problem here is that the composition bounds on the child APZC is getting scaled up as we zoom. This doesn't happen for the parent because the parent's composition bounds is clamped to the screen bounds [1]. (We have plans to remove that behaviour but it doesn't affect this bug on 1.2).
The next contributing factor is that the displayport calculation at [2] doesn't account for this increase in composition bounds. For the parent APZC the composition bounds don't change, so the division by the zoom at line [2] has the desired effect of shrinking the displayport as the zoom increases. For the child APZC the division merely cancels out the increase in composition bounds, and so we end up with a constant-sized displayport (in CSS pixels) regardless of zoom.
So the straightforward fix here would be to just divide again by the zoom. However, we can't do that because in general the child APZC doesn't request content repaints (and hence doesn't recalculate its displayport) while the parent is getting zoomed. So if the child last set a displayport of 500x1000 CSS pixels, and then the parent zooms to 5x what it was before, we would want the child to shrink its displayport down to 100x200 CSS pixels but it never gets a chance. The parent sets the resolution without the child knowing about it, and at that point layout tries to render the child's 500x1000 displayport at a 5x resolution which causes the OOM.
For a fix to work we would either need the parent APZC to notify all other APZCs in its subtree that it's about to change the zoom (and then have the children recalculate their displayport) or, in TabChild::UpdateRootFrame, find all the displayports inside a presShell and shrink them by the right factor. I'll try to see if either of these approaches are viable.

In addition this solution felt pretty hacky and brittle so I'm working on a different solution now which modifies how the displayport is stored. In nsDOMWindowUtils::SetDisplayPortForElement I'm going to multiply in the cumulative resolution and in nsLayoutUtils::GetDisplayPort I'm going to divide out the cumulative resolution. This way when the resolution of intermediate presshells change, the retrieved displayport is automatically scaled accordingly.

Updated patch to shrink the displayport for subframes in APZC code.",CODE_IMPLEMENTATION,1,FULL_TEXT
947523,56,"I've been discussing this issue with :tn and :bkelly and thinking about it, and we might need to take a step back here with the approach taken.
The fundamental problem is that when async subframe scrolling is enabled, we need more memory to render content. This is expected behaviour, but it was always unclear just how much more memory we would need, how it would be bounded, and whether we would often run into OOM situations. For the most part we went with a ""let's do it and see"" approach.
Turns out that with our current implementation (in 1.2+) the memory usage is unbounded, and can easily run into OOM situations. A simple conceptual example is a page that looks something like this:
<body>
 <iframe style=""height: 10000px"" src=""reallylongpage.html""></iframe>
</body>
The iframe is 10,000 pixels tall, and we end up requesting a giant displayport (some multiple of 10000px) for this, because we could scroll either the outer page or the iframe, and need to have enough pre-rendered content to paint all of that. This, of course, will trigger an OOM. Even if the patches I uploaded to this bug worked perfectly we would still probably OOM on this page.
Going forward I think we have to use the visible region of the iframe (i.e. clipped by parent frames and the screen) rather than the full composition bounds as the base for the displayport. However I think that doing this is too risky for 1.2.
For 1.2 I see four main options:
1) Disable subframe apzc. This eliminates the memory requirement and also reduces responsiveness. I suspect this is off the table because of commitments we made to partners.
2) Apply some tweaks to make the OOMs less frequent. This is what I've been trying to do with the above patches, but it's hard to reduce the OOM threshold enough to stop OOMing on this etherpad page because the iframe is huge. It also doesn't guarantee OOMs will not happen.
3) Try some other method to clamp the memory usage, such as putting a hard limit on texture sizes. (I don't know if this can be easily implemented, and it would almost certainly result in scenarios where parts of subframes remain blank.) Another option is to just kill the entire tab if the requested displayport is too big. That limits the crash to a browser tab rather than a phone reboot.
4) Do nothing for 1.2; leave this bug unfixed and ship subframe APZC as-is. Focus efforts on getting a proper fix in for 1.3+

The zoom is always done on the root frame of the page, and it doesn't always know how large the iframes are. So we'd have to plumb all of that in to go with this approach, and even a 2.0 zoom might trigger an OOM if the iframe is large enough. So it still wouldn't completely guard against this case.

If we paint in this state then we will apply the old (small) displayport with the new (high) resolution which could OOM. So this patch prevents that.",CODE_IMPLEMENTATION,1,FULL_TEXT

On trunk it's not necessarily the case that the root frame's GetParentResolution() returns 1.0, at least it won't be after bug 951936 and bug 935219 land, because then the resolution will be on the non-scrollable root layer which will be the parent of the rootmost scrollable layer.

The patch is 1.2-only. I have a much bigger change in mind for 1.3 to try and fix this properly.
Agreed. I can wrap it in an #ifdef if you prefer but since I only plan on having the code land on b2g-1.2 I don't think it matters.
Will do.
Yeah, good catch. I'll add that in.
Yup, I'll do that.
I was able to consistently reproduce the OOM on the hamachi I borrowed from Botond using a 1.2 build without my patch. The STR basically involved zooming in the page as much as possible using the area to the left of the iframe (because putting focus in the frame brings up the keyboard and that thing is impossible to work with) and then trying to scroll the iframe. Usually it would OOM before I even tried scrolling the iframe.

It appears to occur when you zoom in while simultaneously dragging up a bit causing a scroll.  I could not reproduce without the patch.
On IRC kats indicated this might be explainable given that the patch shrinks the displayport.  Is this regression fixable?

947523,77,"I was able to reproduce the painting problem - my hypothesis in comment 74 was wrong. It's caused by part 2; as we zoom in the outer page the displayport (in CSS pixels) of the inner frame will shrink (by design). It remains the same size in layer pixels, but the composition bounds of the inner frame will expand in layer pixels. This results in the displayport shrinking to be smaller than the composition bounds until the APZC for the inner frame triggers a repaint for it.

[Feature/Bug causing the regression]: The culprit is the ""msthemecompatible"" feature as such, but it was mostly harmless until bug 605985 landed which made checkbox/radio controls invisible when ""msthemecompatible"" is requested
[User impact if declined]: invisible checkbox/radio controls (I suspect that ""msthemecompatible"" is very rare on the web though)
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]:no
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]:not yet
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]: sure, there's a testcase in bug 1373417
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]:none
[Is the change risky?]:no
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]:it removes a feature that none of the other major browsers support, and the patch is fairly trivial

It's not a problem with your patch but I am a bit worried about CompositorOGL making virtual method calls in its destructor. We should mark it MOZ_FINAL with a comment saying that if we want to add a subclass of CompositorOGL (which we might do at some point to have platform specific opengl optimization), then we should remove the error-prone virtual calls in the destructor. I'll file a followup bug.
Also, we should be able to call GLContext::MakeCurrent without crashing even after the destruction of the underlying context (it should return false in that case). Some code already expects that to be the case.",CODE_REVIEW,0,FULL_TOKEN

Patch
Arrow functions are currently implemented using a bound function wrapper that passes the modified |this|. This is not ideal for a number of reasons:
(1) It's hard to optimize arrow function calls as they go through the VM fun.bind machinery.
(2) We have to allocate a second JSFunction when cloning arrow lambdas.
(3) It's not spec-compliant, at least in its current form: the bound function is observable via arguments.callee, see bug 889158.
I'm attaching a patch that removes the function binding and instead stores the lexical |this| Value for arrow functions in an extended slot. JSOP_THIS/ComputeThis now use this (no pun intended) Value for arrow functions.
This makes arrow function calls as fast as ""normal"" function calls, and Ion is now able to inline them. For instance, for the micro-benchmark below I get:
before: 1096 ms
after :    3 ms
var sum = (x, y) => x + y;
function f() {
    var res = 0;
    for (var i=0; i<10000000; i++)
	res = sum(i, 1);
    return res;
}
var t = new Date;
f();
print(new Date - t);",PROBLEM_MOTIVATION,0,FULL_TOKEN

initially I created the priority of tunnel stream using the priority of the https stream that triggered the tunnel creation. But we end up putting a lot of different streams on that tunnel perhaps simultaneously and the priority doesn't necessarily apply for long. It also leaks a little information and leads to an inconsistent feel.
So i think a static connect stream priority makes more sense. That would allow us to create a session of only evenly balanced connect streams if necessary down the road.

Set the proper extent on the clip_path in cairo
So as far as my investigation has been able to show this bug is indirectly the results of the extents on a clip path being incorrectly set. At cairo-clip.c:276 we set the extents on the clip_path struct, but those extents no longer contain the real extents but rather the intersection of these clips.
This patch fixes that, however it does have the downside of extents of the top level clip no longer being the intersection of all the clips on the stack, I think that's okay and will only make a difference in some rare perf cases though.",CODE_IMPLEMENTATION,1,FULL_TEXT

having mPausedForPlaybackRateNull was also required because mInitialPlaybackRate isn't modified when MediaDecoder::SetPlaybackRate is called with a value of 0.
so it falls back to setting mInitialPlaybackRate to the proper value.
mInitialPlaybackRate is set to 1.0 in the constructor.
As such, the following call to MediaDecoder::SetStateMachineParameters() will now call SetPlaybackRate with a value of 1.0. Meaning the following call to play, will start playback with a playrate of 1.0.
The whole concept that playback rate has been set is now lost.
You're right, it would cause an assertion (didn't notice it as the state machine isn't defined yet in that particular example).
I do believe that a playbackrate shouldn't be handled any differently than a non-zero playback rate.
it does, as Play() checks the value of mPausedForPlaybackRateNull. If you didn't set to false before the call to play, then playback wouldn't restart",ANSWER_TO_QUESTION,0,FULL_TOKEN

RasterImage currently performs this locking through implicit calls to GetSurface (either in RasterImage itself or in code that it calls like imgFrame::Draw).
I want us to move away from this pattern, and only call GetSurface when we actually want a surface. I wrote a patch to refactor RasterImage to allow this.

This goes from asking for a decode to not asking for a decode, is that okay?

1057903,4,"Thanks for the review, Timothy!
Nah, because GetFrame() calls ForceDiscard() and WantDecodedFrames() automatically.
(BTW, I noticed after writing this patch that we ended up with two methods named GetFrame(), differing only by their argument types. This is confusing and I apologize. =\ I rename the new one, which replaces methods like GetDecodedImgFrame(), to LookupFrame() in one of the next patches up for review. Unfortunately the rebase looks like it'd be pretty ugly so I'd prefer to just live with this for these few patches where it's a problem.)
I don't think asking for a decode here adds much value since animated frames aren't discardable. It has the disadvantage that if we ask for a DrawableFrameRef then we do additional locking that we don't really need here since we aren't going to draw.
(Additionally, this code gets replaced in a later one of the patches up for review right now.)

I don't think we'll be able to get all the tests green on try, since it will always be using m-c's test configuration on try, not b2g32's.

Scroll down and observe that there is a purple border that starts at the top of the chrome and stops 79 pixels from the bottom of the window (79 pixels being the height of the chrome for me). This purple border is the composition bounds of the scrollable content document, but it has a top-left of (0,0) instead of (0,79).
This also means that using the two-finger trackpad scroll gesture doesn't work while the mouse cursor is in the bottom 79 pixels of the content (outside the purple rect).",PROBLEM_DESCRIPTION,0,FULL_TOKEN

What happens is that the Network Monitor code (which is used when the Browser Console is open) intercepts onProgress for its own purposes, and then forwards the message along to the original onProgress listener.  Usually, this works correctly.
However, if |progressMax| is 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF (the ""unknown"" value), things get messed up since we are now going C++ -> JS -> C++, and JS can't safely represent integers that large, so it ends up getting forced to 0 when leaving JS.
I tried clamping the value down to Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER, and this does fix the assertion and crash.  However, I see that are some C++ cases where we check for exactly UINT64_MAX.

So nsIProgressEventSink is a broken interface, at least for JS.

So I was worried about binary extensions, but the good news is that testing an int64_t for equality against UINT64_MAX is the same as testing it for equality against -1, both in terms of machine code and C/C++ integer promotion behavior.  So there should be pretty minimal fallout, if any.

I would prefer we had an actual constant for MAX_SAFE_JS_INTEGER or JS_MAX_SAFE_INTEGER or whatever somewhere, either in jsapi headers (probably preferred) or at least somewhere in mfbt or something.

3. Observe crash; the GMPDecryptor asserts that it expected the sample to have valid crypto data, but it doesn't.
In debugging this, it looked like the auxInfoType of the saiz box was 'sinf', and so we didn't setup crypto data. We set the default auxInfoType of the saiz box to ""sinf"", but ISO/IEC 23001-7:2012(E) says that for CENC files a auxInfoType of 'cenc' should be assumed.

Patch
Ok, so the problem is the async-ness of the DOMMetaAdded dispatch at [1]. The meta viewport tag is parsed before the JS is run, but the DOMMetaAdded event itself isn't dispatched until after, so the MobileViewportManager doesn't update the viewport until after.
I'm not entirely sure how this was working prior to bug 1178847 since it seems like it should have had the same problem. Nonetheless I think the correct fix is to add a synchronous notification of the meta-viewport tag so that we can update the screen properties immediately. The patch also has the side benefit of not running MobileViewportManager code with random non-viewport meta tags are added, which is nice.
However I'm not entirely sure it's ok to be running a reflow synchronously from the DOM building code, if it isn't then I don't see a way to fix this in gecko and it will have to be fixed in the gallery app. Smaug, do you know if this is ok?

This is unfortunately most probably not safe.
We won't reflow at that point, since there are script blockers on stack, but
doing anything like MetaViewportChanged() during BindToTree looks
scary to me. One would need to explicitly prove that MetaViewportChanged call may not run scripts.
So either prove that and assert somewhere hard (RELEASE_ASSERT) that script aren't run, nor events dispatched etc.

Hmm, SetRangeFromFlatTextOffset() is very expensive if offset is too large... If this can be optimized, I'd be happy though. But current code also wastes same amount about this, so, not problem for now.
(If we can retrieve character rects until the end of the frame, we can reduce this call, I guess.)
::: dom/events/ContentEventHandler.cpp:1330

So, I think that this should be GetCharacterRectsInRange(int32_t aOffset, int32_t aLenght, nsTArray<nsRect>& aRects). Then, offset can be increased with aRect.Length().

It seems fine to add this API, but I think the implementation could be cleaned up so as to share code with GetPointFromOffset rather than duplicating it.

I guess returning a zero-sized rect is OK here, but wouldn't it make more sense to do the same thing as GetPointFromOffset to come up with a position? Maybe just call GetPointFromOffset to get the x,y coords, and then set width and height to zero. Or factor out a helper method?
::: layout/generic/nsTextFrame.cpp:7142
(Diff revision 1)
It seems like we should be able to share a lot of the code here with GetPointFromOffset. The two methods are basically doing the same thing, except that the CharacterRect version adds a lookahead to the next cluster so that it can get the advance.
Maybe factor out the body of GetPointFromOffset into a helper that GetCharacterRectFromOffset can also call, and then it just needs to do the extra work to get the extent of the rect. Or have a shared helper that returns a rect, and takes a flag telling it whether we want the full rect (position and size) or only its position, which would allow an early return.",CODE_REVIEW,0,FULL_TOKEN

Please add a comment to clarify why aInOffset is passed as a reference here (as it seems unexpected); looks like it's being clamped to the content range by this method.
It would be nice to pass aProperties as a const reference, so it's clearly an inparam only. I guess to do that, you'd need to pull the InitializeForDisplay() call out of this method and let the caller do it.
Also, the ""Get..."" name seems a bit wrong, as the iterator was already created, this method is just changing its position. Maybe something like ""UpdateIteratorForOffset""? And reorder the params so that aIter (the outparam result) is last, please.

Under certain cases, it will reflow the content with a smaller height constraint when a bigger one has already overflowed.

If a BSize is already infeasible, we should not try a smaller size. Because if

1209952,14,"Ok, I will explain the oddity in the `nsColumnSetFrame` with a further reduced testcase by dropping the surrounding `div` around `dev.float-L` which causes an assertion failure (see my explanation in a comment on phabricator). So the testcase would be:
    <div class=""multicol-b"">
      <div class=""step""></div>
      <div class=""float-L""></div>
    </div>
* 1px=60 logical unit. Both `.step` and `.float-L` have 1px height, thus it's totally 2px=120. And we need at least 40 BSize to place it in 3 columns (120 = 40 * 3).
* At the beginning of the log, it's the outer multicol `.multicol-a` relowing the child #0 with `availBSize=1699`, `float-R` consumes 26px=1560, while the inner multicol has 1px border, which consumes 2*1px=120. So the `availableContentBSize` for the inner one only remains `1699 - 1560 - 120 = 19`. But because of the lack of a `std::min` in initialization, it tries to reflow `40`.

frame dumps
So here's my initial analysis of what happens in the frame tree
that leads up to the crash.  I've colorized the interesting float
continuation chain, and numbered the interesting frames dumps
in a grey background color and numbered them.  Referring to
each of the numbered trees in this log:
1. initially we have a float in the first column
2. we reflow and find that it overflows (but its parent is complete),
   so we put a NIF for it on the OverflowContainersList
3. when reflowing the next column, we find that it still doesn't
   fit so we create another NIF and put it on the PushedFloatsList
   and create a continuation for the parent on ExcessOverflowContainersList
**CRASH**
Now backtracking a bit in rr to see what happens between 3 and the crash...
4. This is the frame tree we start with when reflowing our float (red).
   Note that the inner ColumnSet has a NIF at this point.
5. Backtracking to where we create that ColumnSet NIF.
   I think this is the point where things start to go wrong.
   We've decided that the float's parent doesn't fit in in this
   column at all and we push the lines containing it (creating
   the Overflow-lines list) and create the NIF.
6. At this point the NIF has picked up the Overflow-lines so
   the float first-in-flow is in the ColumnSet NIF and its continuations
   in the previous ColumnSet.  Likewise for the float's parent block
   which is also in the wrong order.  This seems _questionable_ to me.
   Technically, we would either be COMPLETE, in which case we'd delete
   the NIFs, or INCOMPLETE, in which case we'd push them, but still...
From 6, this is essentially what happens, we decide it's COMPLETE
and delete the NIFs.  The reason we crash is that one of the float
NIFs are registered in the float manager, and we try to use it
after it's been deleted (frame-poisoning makes it non-exploitable
though).

If a continuation pulls in children from its prev-in-flow
then it should also move any overflow containers for those
from its OverflowContainers list, to avoid the child
continuations from becoming in the wrong order.
The WIP currently moves them to the principal child list
(mFrames), but ExcessOverflowContainers might be better.

1209952,21,"FTR, there's one more detail I want to highlight in the log above.
At the very end, I print out nsFloatManager::mFloats.  We have
the (float) child of the overflow container (green) at index 0,
and the (red) child float from the line list in slot 1.  This is
because we call ReflowOverflowContainerChildren before reflowing
the principal children (in the lines), so it's added first.
The stack when we add that float is:

In consequence, if Plane::Copy fails due to OOM (which could be intermittent), CreateFrame still sets its |width_| and |height_| members. If the new height and/or width are larger than the old one(s), this causes other code (such as ViEExternalRendererImpl::RenderFrame) to use the larger height and/or width when reading the frame's plane buffers, which causes that code to read memory to which it has no right.

60:   width_ = width;
61:   height_ = height;
62:   return 0;
63: }
The definition of Plane::Copy (from media\webrtc\trunk\webrtc\common_video\plane.cc) is thus:
69: int Plane::Copy(int size, int stride, const uint8_t* buffer) {
70:   if (MaybeResize(size) < 0)
71:     return -1;
72:   memcpy(buffer_.get(), buffer, size);

76: }
The bug can be simulated in the debugger as follows:
   1.  Start FF with one window, one tab;
   2.  Start FF Hello and create a conversation;
   3.  Undock the Hello window from the main window;
   4.  Copy the conversation link into the address bar and join the conversation;
   5.  Share tabs in the Hello window after it's connected;
   6.  Attach a debugger to FF;
   7.  Set a breakpoint on I420VideoFrame::CreateFrame at the call to |y_plane_.Copy| with the condition |height != height_|.
   8.  Rapidly increase the vertical size of the main window;
   9.  When the breakpoint fires:
       a. record the values of |height| and |height_|; and
       b. step into each call to |plane::Copy| and simulate an OOM by skipping the call to |MaybeResize| and instead giving control to |return -1;|
   10. Notice how I420VideoFrame::CreateFrame unconditionally sets |height_ = height|.
   11. Set a breakpoint on ViEExternalRendererImpl::RenderFrame (media\webrtc\trunk\webrtc\video_engine\vie_renderer.cc), where it calls ExtractBuffer.
   12. Let execution proceed.
   13. When the breakpoint fires, step into ExtractBuffer (module webrtc_libyuv.cc) and examine |input_frame.height|. It should be the same as the new value you saw at the breakpoint in I420VideoFrame::CreateFrame;
   14. Now compute |input_frame.y_plane.allocated_size_ / input_frame.y_plane.stride_| and notice that it equals the old, smaller value of |height_| instead of |input_frame.height|.
   15. Notice how ExtractBuffer uses |input_frame.height()| (== |input_frame.height|) to compute the bounds for its inner |for| loop;
   16. If you're using WinDBG (but not VS, alas) set a read breakpoint on the byte just beyond the buffer's end, let execution proceed, and watch it fire (or, if you increased the size of the window a lot, watch it read access-violate).",S2R,0,FULL_TOKEN

Wrap promise resolution values before storing
I seem to recall there were actual reasons for storing the value as-is instead of wrapping into the promise compartment.  Have you run the full test suite with this patch?
In any case, this won't help with the spidermonkey promise implementation, which we're about to turn on.  As in, you're touching code that's about to become dead code.",CODE_REVIEW,0,FULL_TOKEN
1262069,4,"A few tests are still running, but so far most of them have passed.
I could see choosing not to re-wrap the value, on the expectation that some
handlers may be in the same compartment that fulfilled the promise. But I
don't think that should cause any actual problems, unless there are some weird
corner cases with cached WN reflectors.
Even if there are, though, I think that re-wrapping for the target compartment
is the expected behavior. A call to a promise handler for a promise in a
different compartment should be the same as any other call that passes a value
into that compartment. Any code that relies on different behavior is, I think,
broken.
How soon will it be turned on?
I just tested with spidermonkey promises enabled, and I no longer get these
errors. But the unhandled rejections aren't reported, either.
From a quick read through Promise.js and Promise.cpp, it looks like the
resolution values should be wrapped for the compartment that owns the promise
before calling the self-hosted fulfillment methods, so this may not be a
problem there.
Either way, if the new implementation isn't going to be turned on in this

Please before commenting that it works for you, test the exact scenario I reported, and also compare the Mar 7 build vs most recent nightlies. I'm on the latest version of Mac OS X El Capitan on a new Macbook (the tiny ones) - which may or may not be relevant, so make a note of the hardware you're testing on also.
Examples of commands that are excruciatingly slow for me are ""o"" to open categories, ""e"" to mark an item as done, and ""z"" to undo. If I go back to Mar 7 nightly, everything is much much faster.",CLARIFICATION,0,FULL_TOKEN

1263083,24,"I cannot personally reproduce the noticeable performance regression, each of these operations always takes about 1 second for me. I did however notice a change in how it layerizes on the 9th. Dietrich, is it correct that the 7th is the last good build *you aware of*, but that doesn't mean the 8th is necessarily the first bad build? That's how I read the above comments, and is consistent with my findings.
The change I notice is that we are using more multi-tiled layers than before. This would explain why it only affects OS X, although even with tiling enabled on linux I cannot reproduce a noticeable performance regression. I ran a bisection looking out for the extra multi-tiled layers and found bug 1221094 to be the culprit, which makes sense. Memory usage after that commit is greater than before. Each of the operations listed as slow will now result in more memory allocations required to perform them. (Perhaps on a hi-dpi display this would be even more pronounced and therefore cause a more noticeable slow down.)
The commit in question usually causes positive improvements in my experience. But I think the combination of it along with some existing bad decisions on this page is what's causing problems. There should be a way to layerize this page better, I'll keep investigating.",PROBLEM_CAUSE_IDENTIFICATION,0,FULL_TEXT
1263083,25,"Sorry for the brain dump, but here's another. Each email is given its own layer. Previously these were single-tiled layers, so only use memory for the size of the layer. But since bug 1221094 we use mutli-tiled layers for them. So each of these short and wide layers are using tiles that are far too tall for them, hence the massive increase in memory usage. Bug 1243589 made it so that we don't use multi-tiled layers when the layers are smaller than the tile size, but only when both the width AND height are smaller, whereas these layers are short but wide.
We need to update that logic to consider width and height separately. I'm not sure what the correct heuristic would be, but these definitely shouldn't be being multi-tiled. That would fix this regression.
But I also want to find out why each email is getting its own layer in the first place. I'd guess it's something to do with them being transformed, but ideally they'd all be in the one large multi-tiled layer, at least until you hover over one and it gets animated.",POTENTIAL_SOLUTION_DESIGN,1,FULL_TEXT

1315285,5,Those stacks don't seem the culprit I'm hunting for in bug 1293501 as those come with jemalloc4. Note the debug patch may stay a bit longer in the tree (and merge to Aurora) because I haven't seen any access violation write crashes that seems from it.,PROBLEM_REVIEW,0,FULL_TEXT
1315285,6,"... except the patch in bug 1293501 looks wrong to me.
First, it wastes a page by element in the array, even though only the beginning of that array is meant to be protected.
Second, the padding is not large enough to put what follows it out of the protected page.
Third, I don't see anything to handle the array being reallocated when its size changes. Which means the protected page stays there, and can end up being given away to something else by jemalloc, while the array itself is not protected anymore.
Essentially, it seems to me you're *very* lucky that those crashes are not happening with mozjemalloc already. In fact, for all I know, there may well be unidentified crashes due to that patch.",PROBLEM_CAUSE_IDENTIFICATION,0,FULL_TOKEN
1315285,7,"Yes. But if I add padding to only first element, I'll need to overwrite the array functions for accessing the elements, which I think is too much work for debug.
I am not sure I understand, why is this needed? From the crash reports earlier, I found it's likely the first nsEntry in the array has nsCString mData 0x0, but the other fields remains valid. So the protected page includes:
  |nsTArrayHeader|nsEntry.header|padding|nsEntry.value.mData|
which covers mData's orginal address and the shifted address.
The only way to alternate the array is through nsHttpRequestHead APIs like:
https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/86f702229e32c6119d092e86431afee576f033a1/netwerk/protocol/http/nsHttpRequestHead.cpp#162
which each of them has ReentrantMonitorAutoEnter in the beginning of the function. The patch will unprotect the page in the constructor of ReentrantMonitorAutoEnter, and reprotect the page (of course by the updated array mHdr) in its destructor. Also when nsHttpRequestHead is destructed, the page will set back to readwrite.
Could be, but from crash-stats I don't see significant access violation write crashes seems to be caused by this:

Steps to reproduce:
Tested on latest Nightly 53.0a1 (2016-11-21) (64-bit)
-----------OS username disclosure--------
The webkitdirectory on fresh install and profile (or new website where directory has never been uploaded) seems to always default to 'C:\Users\{user}\Desktop'
1. Open PoC on a fresh URL where directory uploading has never been performed (to make sure it defaults to dekstop)
2. Hold down enter 
3. Since webkitdirectory keeps going back a folder every time its used, we only need to make sure a victim keeps hitting enter for at least 2-3 upload dialogues and then we would have successfully grabbed the OS username.
------------Arbitrary File Disclosure--------
Say you go to website 'A' and you upload a directory (doesn't actually have to upload, just as long as you loaded files) that exists in the folder 'C:\Users\{user}\Documents\', if we are able to run the attached PoC on website 'A' (say XSS or if website 'A' is codepen/jsfiddle..etc) we will be able to fool the user into uploading the entire contents of the 'My Documents' folder.
Here is one scenario:
1. Victim visits a codepen link that showcases html5 webkitdirectory.
2. Victim tests this new feature by uploading/selecting a random folder within 'My documents' then forgets about it.
3. Victim receives an attackers website which embeds a codepen code that uses the PoC here.
4. Victim then knowingly exposes his/her files.
As I mentioned, this can also be done with XSS vulnerabilities or possibly even URL spoofing.
Actual results:
In both scenarios we either disclose OS username or we have access to arbitrary files on victims computer.
Expected results:
Two suggestions:
1. Prevent input.click() from bypassing popup blocker, only allow it from mouse clicks.
2. Prevent the behavior where within the Documents folder and its contents (sub folders as well) be uploaded without explicitly choosing such an action. 
For some reason #2 so far only works on Documents folder, the folder uploader seems to ignore this behavior when on C: or desktop folder and others. But if it worked for My Documents my guess is it would work on other locations.",PROBLEM_DESCRIPTION,0,FULL_TOKEN

Bug 1329110. Part 6 - remove StateObject::HandleWaitingForData().
Since DecodingState is the only one that overrides the function, we will let it
just override HandleWaitingFor{Audio,Video}. We also reduce the code complexity
because it is hard to trace the code when one virtual function calls another
virtual function.

It should just use a keyword table, for consistency.
(It's a keyword-valued property; might as well just use our standard keyword-valued-property codepaths, rather than trying to be tricky and hardcoding something more direct and more verbose/error-prone than the normal codepath.)
I think the files to change here are nsCSSPropList.h, nsRuleNode.cpp, and nsComputedDOMStyle.cpp, and nsCSSProps.*",POTENTIAL_SOLUTION_DESIGN,1,FULL_TOKEN
1339619,2,"I suspect the code exists in its current state (eschewing a keyword table) because it's probably a bit faster this way.
However, I claim the perf benefit here doesn't matter too much, since this is a prefixed property which likely doesn't get much usage.  So, better IMO to optimize for code-comprehensibility & maintainability in this case. (Particularly in the nsComputedDOMStyle::DoGetTextSizeAdjust[1] impl -- we can make that a nsCSSProps::ValueToKeywordEnum() invocation, rather than needing a switch statement. And particularly because this seems to be the *only* strictly-keyword-valued-property that does not use a keyword table.[2])
dbaron: are you OK with this change? If you'd prefer to leave this as-is, I'll defer to your judgement.  (It looks like this is code that you originally wrote back in bug 627842.)

Both properties have 2 possible keyword values, one of which is ""none""; seems reasonable that they could have a very similar implementation. But, they can't, because we don't have special ""all"" handling like we do for ""auto"".)
So: in the interests of avoiding similar pitfalls in the future, I'd like to either:
 (1) bring us into alignment with all the other keyword-valued properties here
...OR
 (2) add a comment to the -moz-text-size-adjust section in nsCSSPropList.h to explicitly call out that it's different & hint at why.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Is this all the information we need? I suspect we're going to find out that compared to the number of documents and frames loaded data: urls are a very small fraction. What then? Are there types of data documents we can carve out to get a better sense of what we might break? My first thought was to count sandboxed data: documents because clearly we can't break those, but since such documents would be essentially sandboxed in Chrome already maybe web devs wouldn't bother to add that attribute.
I'd like to know what fraction of top-level data: documents are from navigations/links vs manual entry or bookmark. Whether or not there's a referrer could be a proxy for that, although Referrer Policy and/or user prefs can mess that up. Is there an easy way to check the ""real"" referrer from that point in DocShell? If not I could live with the simpler method and just hope Referrer Policy isn't used much to completely blank the referrer.
Would prefer some descriptive #define or const for the buckets rather than raw numbers, though not sure where you'd stick them that would make much sense. If we ever added buckets that we counted elsewhere it would be even more important.
r- mainly for not counting ""developer"" use of data: vs ""web"" encounters -- I think that's important to help us judge scale.",CODE_REVIEW,0,FULL_TOKEN

bug_1357386_telemetry_data_toplevel.patch
Dan, thanks for your feedback. I flipped the patch around entirely. In fact we are only interested in top level data: URI loads and whether they are navigated or typed into the URL Bar (by a developer or also come from a bookmark).
This patch relies on the triggeringPrincipal (which in most cases is identical to the referrer but also agnostic to the referrer policy). Whenever the a toplevel page is navigated then the triggeringPricnipal is a codebasePrincipal. When typing a data URL into the address bar, the triggeringPrincipal is a systemPrincipal. Similar when clicking a bookmark, then the triggeringPrincipal is a systemPrincipal.
I think that should provide exactly the information we are seeking for: what breakage can we expect if we disallow navigations to data: URIs for toplevel loads.",CODE_IMPLEMENTATION,1,FULL_TOKEN

The sad thing is that none of these measures tells us what we really want to know: how much breakage would we cause by making data: urls not inherit. We might count tons of data: documents but have them all turn out to be perfectly fine without inheritance because they were written for all the other browsers.
We have a pref that flips the behavior so we could do a shield or pref-flipping experiment -- except we need a way to measure the effects if we do so. Where's a good place for that? Maybe the cross-compartment wrapper access check? If it fails check to see if the target or source compartment is a data: url. By doing it on the failure path we should avoid perf impacts (but of course we should measure that, too, as part of the test). Some access failures might be normal, but we could compare the rates from the test groups vs the global population.
The drawback to that is that a small sample study is likely to miss the specific cases that might break: ""Firefox-required"" internal apps for particular enterprises. I guess they could just flip the pref as part of their roll-out.",SOLUTION_REVIEW,1,FULL_TOKEN

0. Returned bool
I think you should document what its value means, probably in the first doc block above.
And it would gently introduce the behaviors. :-)
I see most calls just ignore it. It seems a bit dangerous in a way, especially when the default behavior mentions ""Report"", but then we ignore that report!
Crazy thinking about that: How about having two specializations, so that either the function will be `void`, or will return `MOZ_MUST_USE bool` (Assuming MOZ_MUST_USE can indeed be selectively applied to a specialization.)
Tweaked behaviors could be:
- ProcessFailureBehavior::ReportToCaller -> `MOZ_MUST_USE bool`, and `return false;` if !didSomething.
- ProcessFailureBehavior::Stop -> `void`, and `return;` if !didSomething.
- ProcessFailureBehavior::IgnoreAndContinue -> `void` and no early return.
I'd vote for ReportToCaller to still be the default, as it should force people to think a bit about which behavior to pick at every call, because either they'll need to understand and deal with the return value, or explicitly choose a non-returning behavior.
1. Function name:
Strictly speaking, you're not spinning ""Until"", but more ""WhileNot"" -- i.e., the predicate is tested even before the first event-processing loop.
But it sounds a bit awkward and mind-bending, so I'm not sure it would be such a good idea?
Alternatively, you could change it to ""While"", i.e., reverse the predicate's meaning -- but then you'd have to change every caller! :-P
However most of the original loops were `while (pred)`, which means the predicate would stay the same as it was, instead of having to reverse it as you have (painfully) done!
But then again, it's probably simpler to usually think about how to end a loop, instead of when to keep it running, so as a user I would probably like Until/WhileNot better.
AARGH! Sorry for the over-thinking. I'll let you decide...
2. Predicate parameter:
Take it by '&&'. As it's a templated type, the most appropriate passing method will be taken, potentially avoiding some copies.

Instead of `if (B==I) { continue; } else if (!d) {return}` you could just do `if (B==R && !d) {return}`, it feels simpler to me in this case.

Sort of.  I guess we could warn.
Ah, no.  I was originally moving MOZ_ALWAYS_TRUE into the event loop spinner itself, but that's obviously not correct in general.
Same deal here.
Ugh.  So it was intended, because this is silly code: try to process an event if one's there...if not, sleep, and then try to do the same thing again.  Why not just wait in the thread's event queue itself instead?  Probably more efficient.
I thought the condition is set by a runnable sent to the current thread.  But it can actually be triggered by runnables run on other threads (?).  The comment suggests that we have to do things this way because other code can run on this thread (?), but I think the person who wrote the comment must have been confused.
Upshot: I think the conversion is correct, but you have to squint at it kind of funny to see.
Oh, it probably does!  I guess it will be checked ""outside"" the loop, but that's probably not such a bad thing.
Same deal as before.
I kind of like this idea, but then I have to audit every site that I use this function at, and I'm not confident of being able to identify the correct behavior at every site.  I guess maybe ReportToCaller for all the places that use MOZ_ALWAYS_TRUE or similar, and IgnoreAndContinue for everybody else?  I'm also not sure that Stop would ever be the correct behavior during shutdown, for reasons (obliquely) described in the comment for the enum.

Does having to busy-wait here mean that |done| is getting written from some other thread than the one doing the waiting (ugh)?",QUESTION,0,FULL_TOKEN
1359490,11,"Hi Nathan,
AysncApplyUpdate() would just post an event to a separate thread (let's call it
the update thread) for update and notify the result via a callback on the 
caller thread. 
The intention is to wrap that AysncApplyUpdate() to a synchronous update API
for test case itself. (since the very original API is synchronous and all the
test cases were written with that assumption in mind.)
I was supposed to use a condition variable or a simple busy-wait to synchronize with 
the AsyncApplyUpdate()'s completion. However, I ended up failing to do any of them
because somewhere on the update thread would ""SyncRunnable to main thread"" 
be done for initializing NS_CRYPTO_HASH_CONTRACTID [1], which is triggered by [2].
As a result, on the main thread, we have to wait and process pending events
to unblock the update thread. |done| is only a flag for the main thread to know
if AsyncApplyUpdate() has been complete.
To get rid of that busy-wait, I have no better solution than pre-initializing
NS_CRYPTO_HASH_CONTRACTID on non-main thread prior to calling AsyncApplyUpdate().
However, in that case, we still have to synchronize with the completion of 
creating NS_CRYPTO_HASH_CONTRACTID on the main thread.

(part 3) - Overhaul TickSample and things around it
Bug 1357829 added a third kind of sample, in addition to the existing
""periodic"" and ""synchronous"" samples. This patch cleans things up around that
change. In particular, it cleans up TickSample, which is a mess of semi-related
things.
The patch does the following.
- It removes everything from TickSample except the register values and renames
  TickSample as Registers. Almost all the removed stuff is available in
  ThreadInfo anyway, and the patch adds a ThreadInfo argument to various
  functions. (Doing it this way wasn't possible until recently because a
  ThreadInfo wasn't available in profiler_get_backtrace() until recently.)
  One non-obvious consequence: in synchronous samples we used to use a value of
  0 for the stackTop. Because synchronous samples now use ThreadInfo directly,
  they are able to use the proper stack top value from ThreadInfo::mStackTop.
  This will presumably only improve the quality of the stack traces.
- It splits Tick() in two and renames the halves DoPeriodicSample() and
  DoSyncSample().
- It reorders arguments in some functions so that ProfileBuffer (the output) is
  always last, and inputs are passed in roughly the order they are obtained.
- It adds a comment at the top of platform.cpp explaining the three kinds of
  sample.
- It renames a couple of other things.",CODE_IMPLEMENTATION,1,FULL_TOKEN

The release engineering team is working on having tests migrated to Taskcluster before 56 reaches beta (August 2nd), as tier-1. We noticed a regression on our testing branch.

On version 54 and above, Firefox were able to retrieve the correct duration anyway ; since 55 it returns Infinity.
Note that chrome always returned Infinity, but there is a workaround[2] for them, which consists in setting the currentTime of the video to a large number. The duration is then correctly set. FF55+ doesn't allow this workaround to work : duration is always Infinity, even when it knows the actual duration.
The current workaround I use is to grab the value of currentTime after I set it to the large number. But currentTime property can't be overridden by scripts, so this implies an ugly _duration property...
To make things even worse, when the ended event fires, the currentTime property too is set to Infinity.
So all in all, the best would be to retrieve the previous behavior (automagically grab the duration), and if it's really too hard, at least update the duration once it is known.

There are several issues revealed by this bug:
1. We have MediaDecoder::mInfiniteStream==true to present an infinite stream. However, mDuration==inf can also present an infinite stream. This causes inconsistency and fails to mark the stream as finite when playback reaches the end.
2. http://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/bbc1c59e460a27b20929b56489e2e55438de81fa/dom/media/MediaDecoderStateMachine.cpp#2009-2012
MDSM adjust playback position to max(clockTime, mMaster->Duration()) when playback reaches the end. Since mMaster->Duration() returns inf in this case, we end up having mediaElement.currentTime==inf.
3. http://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/bbc1c59e460a27b20929b56489e2e55438de81fa/dom/media/MediaDecoderStateMachine.cpp#2252

Bug 1385699. P2 - rewrite the code of calculating duration in MDSM.
We pretty much rewrite the whole logic of duration calculation of MDSM.
The new logic is much simpler for we have only one duration to manage
which is mDuration. Below is the details of the code changes:
1. remove the mExplicitDuration mirror since it should be handled in MediaDecoder.
2. remove mObservedDuration and mDuration will take its place.
3. mDuration is updated from:
   a. metadata
   b. playback position as playback progresses.
   c. buffer ranges.
4. change mDuration to be finite when playback reaches the end.

Since inf can be encoded in MDSM::mDuration, we don't need an additional flag
in MediaDecoder to indicate 'infinite' anymore. Note duration change from infinite
to finite is handled by MDSM, so we can remove the explicit calls to SetInfinite(false).

Potentially yes, I'm not sure if extensions couldn't just read any file they wanted anyway.
Maybe that's not true now that (I think) web extensions will be running in their own process.
Maybe this could also just be done for IsDevelopmentBuild().
Perhaps that wouldn't work if you were running tests on a packaged build.

I don't think it's correct to use these variables if these tests need to access these directories not-via-symlinks (or stated another way, if Windows is affected, I don't think these are the right solution :-)).

testcase, SVG text with text-shadow
See testcase: the SVG text renders with colored stroke and fill, as specified in the attributes of the <svg> element, and inherits its font family/weight/size from the body. But it fails to render the text-shadow that was also specified on the body element.
(The fact that these properties are inherited from the body in this example is irrelevant; behavior is the same if they're specified in an inline style attribute on the <text> element itself.)
Safari and Chrome both render the expected shadow on the SVG text.

Don't skip rendering text-shadow when we're painting SVG text without selection
The example here is fixed by simply removing the \!aParams.callbacks guard that prevents us rendering the shadow in the (no-selection) PaintText path. It looks like this dates back to bug 655877, originally as the separate aCallbacks param, later moved to the PaintTextParams struct. So :heycam, do you know if removing this will break anything? (Existing reftests seem to be fine with it, according to https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=2b5eb4766f666c114f0bf5ea348aef7f920edebc, so if it does result in problems that implies we're lacking suitable test coverage...)",CODE_IMPLEMENTATION,1,FULL_TEXT

The second case is when we have SVG patterns, strokes, etc.  In this case, where we're still painting the text normally, it does make sense to just go ahead and paint the shadow, and not bother about going through a callback function to do it either.
One thing to check would be that when we're in here due to <clipPath>, that aParams.IsPaintText() is indeed false.  It might be we only set that for background-clip:text.  Can you check that Jonathan?
I guess the bug 889235 testcase works because ShouldRenderAsPath() returns false, since the text has no stroke and uses a solid fill colour, so we don't have a callbacks object.",POTENTIAL_SOLUTION_DESIGN,1,FULL_TOKEN

improved testcase with shadows on various SVG text styles
Here is a more extensive testcase that renders SVG text with a variety of attributes, and (in all cases) with a text-shadow style in effect.
Currently, the most obvious bug we have is that the text-shadow only appears for text that is rendered with fill (but no stroke).
Doing a ""Select All"" on the testcase makes shadows appear on all the examples. However, looking at exactly how the shadows are rendered raises further questions:
- When the text has a stroke but no fill, should the shadow be a ""solid"" shadow as if the text were filled, or should it be a shadow of only the stroke? In both Safari and Chrome, it's the stroke that casts the shadow here.
- What about partially-opaque text: should the shadow adopt the same opacity as the element? Chrome and Safari do that for SVG text, though this does not apply to partially-opaque HTML text, which still casts a fully-opaque shadow (in all browsers). The difference between their SVG and HTML behavior seems odd.
- Is is appropriate for text-shadow to apply to text used as a clipPath (i.e. to contribute to the clip region)? It kinda does so when selected, but it looks like we get the position a bit wrong. Both Safari and Chrome do this, though in Safari the positioning also looks wrong (in a different way from ours).

[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
It's easy since the patch includes the testcase to reproduce this crash.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
I don't think so. This looks like just a crash bug fix if there is no link to this closed bug report.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
Not sure but ESR 52 doesn't support <detail> and the testcase won't work as expected.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
Not sure. Possible to change native anonymous subtree in <input>/<textarea> with execCommand() must be long standing bug. However, the crash itself must be newer bug since a lot of safer code have been replaced with faster code with Quantum Flow.
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
I created same patch for Beta branch too.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
This patch just avoids to insert unexpected DOM nodes into <input>/<textarea>'s anonymous subtree.  And such behavior has never been expected.  Therefore, this patch must be safe.  And also this patch includes the testcase of comment 0.",SOLUTION_VERIFICATION,0,FULL_TOKEN

Approval Request Comment
[Feature/Bug causing the regression]:
Not sure. This root cause must be a long standing bug. However, the crash must be caused by Quantum Flow since a lot places started to assume native anonymous subtree in <input>/<textarea> are always expected structure. Therefore, the crash is not reproducible with ESR 52.
[User impact if declined]
Might get odd HTML tree (i.e., |foo.innerHTML = bar.innerHTML;| doesn't create same DOM tree since <input> cannot have any children at parsing HTML document). And of course, may meet the crash.
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]:
Not yet. We should land it after release.
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]:
Not yet, but I confirmed it with local build.
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]:
Yes, load attachment 8967914 and check if it won't cause crash.
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]:
Nothing.
[Is the change risky?]:
No.
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]:
This adds an additional check to HTMLEditor::GetBetterInsertionPointFor(). The additional new check is, if it's not in native anonymous subtree.  If it's in, it returns host element of the native anonymous subtree.
[String changes made/needed]:

1456911,1,"I haven't tested this yet, but it seems to be the case from code inspection: if a file descriptor in LaunchOptions::fds_to_remap has the same numeric value in the parent as the child, it won't have its close-on-exec bit cleared.  (In contrast, the general case dup2()s the descriptor, which does clear close-on-exec.)  So if the fd was close-on-exec, which is the general best practice, it will be closed on exec instead of inherited.
Note that dup2(x, x) is defined as a no-op and POSIX specifically says it won't change the close-on-exec bit, so that will need to be done explicitly.
This *probably* isn't a problem in practice, because the low-valued fds we map things to will *probably* wind up occupied by long-lived fds in the parent process… but maybe not.  In any case I'd like to rule this out as a possible cause of bug 1455828.

Bug 1456911 - Prelude: Fix unified build breakage exposed by the next patch.
This directory has a number of places where files unintentionally depend
on `#include`s and `using` directives and forward declarations in other
files in the same unified build group.  Adding a file shifts the group
boundaries and exposes some of those bugs; this patch fixes them (but
there are others).

Bug 1456911 - Rewrite the fd shuffling to be simpler & handle identity mappings correctly.
This replaces some old Chromium code that tries to minimally disentangle
an arbitrary file descriptor mapping with simpler algorithm, for several
reasons:
1. Do something appropriate when a file descriptor is mapped to the same
fd number in the child; currently they're ignored, which means they'll
be closed if they were close-on-exec.  This implementation duplicates
the fd twice in that case, which seems to be uncommon in practice; this
isn't maximally efficient but avoids special-case code.
2. Make this more generally applicable; the previous design is
specialized for arbitrary code running between fork and exec, but we
also want to use this on OS X with posix_spawn, which exposes a very
limited set of operations.
3. Avoid the use of C++ standard library iterators in async signal safe
code; the Chromium developers mention that this is a potential problem in
some debugging implementations that take locks.
4. In general the algorithm is simpler and should be more ""obviously
correct""; more concretely, it should get complete coverage just by being
run normally in a debug build.
As a convenient side benefit, CloseSuperfluousFds now takes an arbitrary
predicate for which fds to leave open, which means it can be used in
other code that needs it without creating a fake fd mapping.

https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/c7726ff56cbf
This code is from eight years ago when we were still recursing up the frame invalidating each frame whenever we needed to invalidate something. The code was introduced to prevent an invalidation loop. What was happening is that the frame with a filter(#parent) would invalidate, the recursive invalidation would recurse up the frame tree, invalidating the parent which would post a (change hint) restyle event at the original frame referencing the ""filter"" parent. Hence, invalidation loop forever.
Now that we are in a DLBI world the original reason to have this hack has gone.",PROBLEM_MOTIVATION,0,FULL_TOKEN
1494092,2,"Unfortunately, removing this code causes the following two reftests to fail:
  layout/reftests/invalidation/scroll-inactive-layers.html
  layout/reftests/invalidation/scroll-inactive-layers-2.html
These tests check that scrolling doesn't cause repainting of inactive (opacity/transform/filter/mask) layers.
Despite the IsInObserverList code being purely for filters, it is the masked element that is repainting on scroll, causing the test failure.
The relevant change to the code is the removal of the first highlighted block here:
https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/layout/svg/nsSVGIntegrationUtils.cpp#328-330,334-341
What seems to happen is that, with the removal of the first `if` block we no longer early return aInvalidRegion. Instead we enter the second `if` block because 'observers' is nullptr (since the nsSVGMaskFrame does not have a SVGFilterObserverListForCSSProp of course) and return the value computed there.
Specifically in my testing, before removing the hack we return aInvalidRegion with the values:
  left     748
  top     2104
  right    952
  bottom  4458
After removing the first `if` block we return:
  left     748

    .ToOutsidePixels(appUnitsPerDevPixel);
whereas what we return when we fail is:
  (frame->GetVisualOverflowRect() + aToReferenceFrame)
    .ToOutsidePixels(appUnitsPerDevPixel)
There's clearly a bug in the removed `if` block where it fails to take account of aToReferenceFrame, and that that bug is hiding the fact that even without my change we are *already* invalidating the masked element in the two failing reftests. The only reason that the tests don't actually fail is because the preexisting bug results in the invalid area being offscreen.
The fact that these tests should already currently be failing makes me think that they shouldn't block removing this old hack.

1514429,1,"window.inner{Width,Height} currently return the dimensions of the visual viewport. (Background of layout vs. visual viewport terminology: [1].)
This has been changed a couple of times aready (bug 602580, bug 919437), but I believe we'll need to change it again to align with Blink, which has settled on reporting the layout viewport dimensions [2].
Their justification for that choice is that we have the VisualViewport API [3] to report the visual viewport dimensions; I think that's reasonable.
We probably want to wait until shipping the Visual Viewport API (bug 1512813) before making this change.

1514429,2,"I've been looking at this. The getters return visual viewport (nsIPresShell::GetVisualViewportSize) only when the visual viewport is overridden, and return the layout viewport (nsPresContext::GetVisibleArea) otherwise. Setters behave similarly. That means that most of the time we're using the layout viewport. Visual viewport override occurs when Responsive Design Mode is enabled.
I'd like to fix this right away because it is a blocker for Responsive Design Mode bugs like Bug 1504659. Given that RDM already has bugs regarding the visual viewport, is there a problem with making the change now to make innerWidth and innerHeight ALWAYS use the layout viewport?",POTENTIAL_SOLUTION_DESIGN,1,FULL_TEXT
1514429,3,"If nsIPresShell::IsVisualViewportSizeSet() returns false, the visual and layout viewports have the same size. So, it is the case that currently inner{Width,Height} always evaluates to the visual viewport size. The only reason we have a condition here [1] is that when nsIPresShell::IsVisualViewportSizeSet() returns false, no one has set nsIPresShell::mVisualViewportSize, so we'd be trying to use an empty size if we called nsIPresShell::GetVisualViewportSize() in that case.
If we make this change before shipping the Visual Viewport API, we would be depriving page authors of a way to obtain the visual viewport size.
If you give some more details about how this is causing a problem for RDM, I may be able to suggest an alternate solution.

1514429,4,"I had assumed that a meta viewport tag would change the layout viewport size without affecting the visual viewport, and without setting nsIPresShell::IsVisualViewportSizeSet(), leading to a mismatch. If that is not the case, and IsVisualViewportSizeSet() is equivalent to ""visual viewport may differ from layout viewport"", then I agree there is no problem here.
In Bug 1504659 I need the actual viewport width. The actual visible amount of the document. I see now that GetVisualViewportSize() returns both the viewable area and the area covered by any visible scrollbars. By subtracting away the area of the scrollbars, I should be able to get what I need. I'll needinfo you (on that bug) if I have trouble.",POTENTIAL_SOLUTION_DESIGN,1,FULL_TEXT

I believe the only scenario where we process a meta viewport tag but don't set a visual viewport size, is fixed by [this patch](https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D13173). So, with that patch in place, there should be no problem.

The content in the test case has `minimum-scale=0.5` and a `width: 200%` element, but the root element height is `height: 100%`, so the content is shrunk to fit the 200% width to the screen, but nsPresContext.mVisibleArea (i.e. height:100%)is unchanged, so once we return the nsPresContext.mVisibleArea for window.innnerHeight, it's no longer correct, it should be size of the expanded size by the minimum-scale.

Bug 1514429 Part 4: Update tests and test functions that conflated visual viewport and layout viewport.
Responsive Design Mode sends internal messages for the content size and
viewport size. The viewport size used to be reflective of the visual
viewport. These changes make it use the layout viewport instead.
The viewport is also being used as a stand-in for RDM device size. That
needs more investigation since content size and viewport size should be
conceptually distinct. This need for clarity is less urgent because the
RDM feature is being rebuilt for Fission support, tracked by
Bug 1574885. If this issue becomes problematic before Bug 1574885 is

Has the fix been verified in Nightly?: No
Needs manual test from QE?: No
If yes, steps to reproduce: 
List of other uplifts needed: None
Risk to taking this patch: Low
Why is the change risky/not risky? (and alternatives if risky): Just adds back a `break;` statement which prevents us to fall back to the solid border path we use when the border is too small.

But I have some questions
1. Do we need the if clause check below?
`if (!mozilla::IsPointer<T>::value || thing)`

https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/05d4b6962a571585bd679d2bbb0df0a5fb4e4eff/js/public/GCVariant.h#79
the `if (thing)` check is initially for pointer types
and the pointer check is done again in https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/05d4b6962a571585bd679d2bbb0df0a5fb4e4eff/js/src/gc/Policy.h#47
and `!mozilla::IsPointer<T>::value` is also confusing to me. 
Do we really need this?
2. Do we still need to call TraceRoot

Oh, I hadn't thought of that approach. I was thinking of allowing Rooted<Variant<...>> to contain untraceable types. But come to think of it, your approach seems good -- it keeps the exception localized to types involved.

I like this approach, it's simple and it's obvious what's happening.  Steve's approach is more general though.
I guess we'll see how often we need this - if it turns out to be a lot we can shift to the other approach, but for now I'd say let's go with this.

I'll split the patch into three parts:

2) Function call cleanup.
3) Deleting pn_op and refactoring all the ParseNode constructors/FullParseHandler/etc. to not provide opcodes.
Point 2 is a little weird, because I'll be adding a CallNode that contains a JSOp field. This is because there are a *lot* of different types of calls, and those are currently encoded into JSOp (for example, CALL, SPREADCALL, NEW, SPREADNEW, SUPERCALL, SPREADSUPERCALL, the list goes on and on).

* Whether we need a EventNameType_MathML flag that would basically duplicate the EventNameType_HTML one.

How likely is compat fallout?  If we were putting things behind a flag here, which things would go behind the flag?
The only reason the `EventNameType` thing exists is for purposes of implementing `IsEventAttributeNameInternal`.  If you can get the right behavior without adding a new one, I wouldn't introduce a new one.
That seems reasonable.  Some such logic is already factored into `nsStyledElement`.  We could either move move things into there or add another class below or above it.  Followup for this is ok, though filing the followup now, with a list of things that can be shared, might not be a bad idea.

Second, this pattern around LsaLogonUser is fragile:

  ScopedHANDLE scopedToken(token);
  if (sts ...) {

Generally the contract with Windows APIs is that you can rely on them to populate output parameters as long as the API succeeds.
If the API fails, `token` may be left uninitialized, and the RAII helper's `CloseHandle` could do bad things.

1600320,1,"The attached crash information was detected while running CI tests with ThreadSanitizer on mozilla-central revision 66531295716a.
This race looks very similar to bug 1533521 with the exception that the writing code here is in the Rust function `set_len` instead of the `SetLength` C++ counterpart. Not sure if we can apply the same or a similar fix like we did in bug 1533521. Fixing this race is highly desirable because it is by far one of the most frequent races we currently have in tests (over 500 times in Mochitests alone).
### General information about TSan reports
#### Why fix races?
Data races are undefined behavior and can cause crashes as well as correctness issues. Compiler optimizations can cause racy code to have unpredictable and hard-to-reproduce behavior.
#### Rating
If you think this race can cause crashes or correctness issues, it would be great to rate the bug appropriately as P1/P2 and/or indicating this in the bug. This makes it a lot easier for us to assess the actual impact that these reports make and if they are helpful to you.
#### False Positives / Benign Races
Typically, races reported by TSan are not false positives [1], but it is possible that the race is benign. Even in this case it would be nice to come up with a fix if it is easily doable and does not regress performance. Every race that we cannot fix will have to remain on the suppression list and slows down the overall TSan performance. Also note that seemingly benign races can possibly be harmful (also depending on the compiler, optimizations and the architecture) [2][3].
[1] One major exception is the involvement of uninstrumented code from third-party libraries.
[2] http://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2013/01/06/benign-data-races-what-could-possibly-go-wrong
[3] How to miscompile programs with ""benign"" data races: https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/hotpar11/tech/final_files/Boehm.pdf
#### Suppressing unfixable races
If the bug cannot be fixed, then a runtime suppression needs to be added in `mozglue/build/TsanOptions.cpp`. The suppressions match on the full stack, so it should be picked such that it is unique to this particular race. The bug number of this bug should also be included so we have some documentation on why this suppression was added.",ADDITIONAL_CONSIDERATION,0,FULL_TOKEN

1614706,1,"The attached crash information was detected while running CI tests with ThreadSanitizer on mozilla-central revision 11c9c5ce3955.
Looks like a simple race on `mStatus` being updated vs. it being used in `RemoveInput`.
### General information about TSan reports
#### Why fix races?
Data races are undefined behavior and can cause crashes as well as correctness issues. Compiler optimizations can cause racy code to have unpredictable and hard-to-reproduce behavior.
#### Rating
If you think this race can cause crashes or correctness issues, it would be great to rate the bug appropriately as P1/P2 and/or indicating this in the bug. This makes it a lot easier for us to assess the actual impact that these reports make and if they are helpful to you.
#### False Positives / Benign Races
Typically, races reported by TSan are not false positives [1], but it is possible that the race is benign. Even in this case it would be nice to come up with a fix if it is easily doable and does not regress performance. Every race that we cannot fix will have to remain on the suppression list and slows down the overall TSan performance. Also note that seemingly benign races can possibly be harmful (also depending on the compiler, optimizations and the architecture) [2][3].
[1] One major exception is the involvement of uninstrumented code from third-party libraries.

[3] How to miscompile programs with ""benign"" data races: https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/hotpar11/tech/final_files/Boehm.pdf
#### Suppressing unfixable races
If the bug cannot be fixed, then a runtime suppression needs to be added in `mozglue/build/TsanOptions.cpp`. The suppressions match on the full stack, so it should be picked such that it is unique to this particular race. The bug number of this bug should also be included so we have some documentation on why this suppression was added.",ADDITIONAL_CONSIDERATION,0,FULL_TOKEN

1623400,21,":ckerschb I don't think this is a server bug. 
Autopush (the mozilla push server), hasn't changed since [October of last year](https://github.com/mozilla-services/autopush-rs/releases). 
I know for a fact that it does not use any of the `Sec-Fetch-*` headers since I just found out about them today while working with the client team on this issue. In addition, if it were a server side issue, sites like https://pushalert.co/demo would also fail. I, too, am confused why that site works yet older code like https://serviceworke.rs/push-simple_demo.html does not. I'm able to connect to the push servers using a python websocket client:

I'll admit that my expertise is in back end and not user agent code, so I'm at a loss to figure out why a connection under nightly is clearly failing. 
I know that the server will reject any connection that initially sends empty or invalid data, but again, the code linked above does not appear to do that (unless there's some recent change inside of `Ci.nsIWebSocketChannel`)
I think we're just at a loss to determine what might be causing this sudden failure.",PROBLEM_REVIEW,0,90_PCT_MATCH

I didn't see any that sent me a ""push"" when I wasn't on the site itself.
The only ""broken"" one I've seen so far is the https://gauntface.github.io/simple-push-demo/ one from earlier. Unlike comment 6 it worked just fine in Firefox 74. It's also the only demo site I've seen making requests to `wss://push.services.mozilla.com/`. With the sec-fetch- headers that request doesn't get any response at all. With the sec-fetch headers turned off then I get the expected 101 response and the websocket set-up HTTP headers.
Is there a load-balancer or something in front of that service that's choking on the sec-fetch headers? Is the server itself looking for `Sec-` headers instead of `sec-websocket-` headers and getting confused that there are too many of them?",QUESTION,0,FULL_TOKEN

Totally understandable, and these sorts of things can and will happen. As I know you feel intimately, there's an endless tsunami of specifications, features and changes that don't always get propagated to where they should and not everyone always has the bandwidth to monitor every change coming down the pike. It can often be better to over communicate rather than assume ""they'll find out, I suppose"".

I don't have the ability to delve into the active User Agent Push internals but there are a few possible reasons for the failure:
1) The client is failing to send the push ""hello"" packet for some reason. 
2) The client is failing to accept the push ""hello"" response for some reason.
3) Something in between the WebPush.jsm calls outlined in #20 and the actual websocket network dispatch is intercepting or preventing the data. 
The push server is deeply, deeply indifferent about any additional header values. It ignores anything that is unknown or unexpected.
As noted, setting the `dom.security.secFetch.enabled` to false allows the socket data to be exchanged and the push service to resume. (I'll note that even in the case of a success, the browser console does not display the exchanged information, so I can only verify off of expected DOM event behaviors.)

Note also that I used the following `--header` arguments and that they were relayed in the `websocat::sessionserve` body:
* Sec-Fetch-Dest: websocket
* Sec-Fetch-Mode: websocket
* Sec-Fetch-Site: cross-site
* Sec-WebSocket-Extensions: permessage-deflate
* Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: push-notification
These include the headers you note. including `Sec-Fetch-Dest: websocket` which you report as not working. 
(The sessionserve message transcribes the values of these strings into byte arrays, so some use of an ascii chart may be required to verify.)
What this means is that a simple client that specifies these headers and values is indeed able to send and receive data from the mozilla WebPush servers. 
Look, I don't want to be contrarian or sound overly negative here, but I feel like we're arguing that the road must be broken because your car won't start after you changed the oil. I understand that firefox is a highly complex virtual machine. Far more complex than the push server. That's why I'm trying to provide as much tooling as possible so that you can solve this problem. It may not be with the code responsible for writing these headers (again, highly complex virtual machine), but it could be surfacing because of some inter-relationship around how the browser should act regarding handling these headers. I don't know, either.
In fact, if you like, you can run [a fake Push Server](https://github.com/vi/websocat) locally, and alter `dom.push.serverURL` to point to it. (Websocket is an upgraded HTTP connection, so the server should listen on ports 80 for (`ws://`) or 443 (for `wss://`) just like a normal HTTP server.) The client should connect and send the ""hello"" message I've been using. (I'll remind that firefox tends to treat `localhost` specially, so it might be worth trying a different address as well.)
I am not sure how I can possibly proceed on this further. I completely agree that firefox 76.0a1 (2020-03-18+) is unable to properly communicate to the server in order to initiate a push connection. This is not the case for older versions of firefox, or independent clients. I have neither the tools nor experience in order to work out why the internal websocket channels within firefox in order to further diagnose or resolve this issue, but continue to be happy to assist where I can. I will gleefully fix and frankly be in rapture if this does turn out to be a server side issue but I am unable to replicate it using anything other than firefox 76.0a1 (2020-03-18+) which, again, leads me to believe that the problem is not with the server.",CLARIFICATION,0,90_PCT_MATCH

1623400,39,"So as a bit of follow up here while I enjoy this plate of crow:
In the rust application, we use `httparse`, which parses and reads the HTTP headers, but uses a user provided `mut slice`. (e.g.
```rust
use httparse;
let mut headers = [httparse::EMPTY_HEADER; 16];
let mut req = httparse::Request::new(&mut headers);
```
while 16 may have been plenty in the past, the new headers pushed us to 17. Literally one more than we expected, which triggered an out of bounds error that resulted in a `too many headers` debug message that got dropped because we don't log those.
The very short term fix is to just double the number of accepted headers (to 32).",POTENTIAL_SOLUTION_DESIGN,1,FULL_TEXT

1623400,47,"Correct, this error is on the server and is triggered by more than 16 headers. 
It has been addressed by https://github.com/mozilla-services/autopush-rs/releases/tag/1.55.0
In our case, we were using a rust library called ""[httparse](https://crates.io/crates/httparse)"" that for reasons takes a pre-allocated set of header slots and populates them. Since we had no idea how many headers we were going to be using, we used the demo code value of ""16"". Everything worked just fine for a long time, until the new set of headers pushed us over by literally one header. That's when things broke for us. 
I've [filed an issue](https://github.com/seanmonstar/httparse/issues/70) with that packages authors to have them tweak the demo number up a significant chunk. 
I don't think it's possible to say how end sites might be impacted, since there's not a common set of actions around header processing. I'm sure that many sites will simply ignore these headers and work fine. Others might hit the new header and raise warnings, and I'm sure that some will fail for similar reasons (or maybe the request will exceed whatever buffer size they originally allocated and it'll fail for that reason). 
Honestly, the best we can do is to better advertise these headers out to server folk. I can tell you that we don't generally follow header changes with slavish devotion because we're trying to figure out why the `foo-baz` library 0.192.3 breaks code written with `foo-baz` library 0.192.2 and who the hell is using a library named `foo-baz` since all the documentation just says ""TBD"".",CLARIFICATION,0,90_PCT_MATCH

Bug 1651332. Use purely relative scroll offset updates for many scrollbar initiated scrolls. r?kats
We already have relative updates (they use a base offset and compute the difference from that to get the offset to apply) but they only seem to know about layout scroll positions. Ideally these two would be merged.
We need to communicate with apz to do the scroll because we need to update the visual viewport offset (apz is in charge of that), and usually we need to smooth scroll to the new offset.

1651332,7,I'm having trouble making sense of that last patch. Can you provide more context in this bug as to what kind of problem that patch is solving? In general it's also good to link this bug to the other ones (presumably 1639450 and 1642500) that this work supports and describe what kind of problems this bug is solving or how these patches help those bugs.,QUESTION,0,FULL_TEXT
1651332,8,"Right sorry. I'll explain a little here and then update the commit message with some more details.
The last patch is basically to make clicking in the scrollbar track outside of the scrollthumb ""work"", so it's pretty close to bug 1639450. Clicking in the scrollbar track usually does a page scroll via nsSliderFrame::PageScroll. This eventually ends up in ScrollFrameHelper::ScrollBy where turn the request from a relative one (""scroll by a page"") into an absolute one (""scroll to this position"").
This page scroll is typically a smooth scroll and is currently done on the main thread/layout side. Once we start scrolling the visual viewport offset with the scrollbars we can no longer do this purely on the layout side, we at least need the help of the compositor side. I think the simplest way to do this is to hand the scroll request off to the compositor and have it handle the whole thing.
Now we need to consider the following situation: user clicks scrollbar track to page scroll, smooth scroll gets partway complete on the compositor, user clicks again on scrollbar track for a further page scroll. The main thread can't send an absolute scroll offset update request to the compositor at this point because it has outdated information (it needs a 'starting position' to add the page scroll offset amount) so it'll end up scrolling to the wrong place. It has to send a relative scroll offset update.
We already have a mechanism to send relative scroll offset updates. It is implemented by sending a base scroll offset and the desired scroll offset, and then on the compositor send the difference between those two is computed and then added to the scroll offset.
I used a new mechanism (so called ""pure relative"") that just sends a relative offset update without any absolute scroll positions. The reason I did this is because the existing relative scroll offset update mechanism is not aware of visual viewport offsets, but rather only layout scroll position. For example, here
https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/8d55e18875b89cdf2a22a7cba60dc40999c18356/layout/generic/nsGfxScrollFrame.h#446
the value we use for the base scroll offset (mApzScrollPos) is set to the layout scroll position. It may be entirely reasonable to make this existing mechanism vv offset aware, but I wanted to implement something to get it working with a smaller chance of regressions to things that already exist and work. We could unify these two mechanisms either before or after landing this bug by either: 1) making the existing relative scroll update mechanism work with vv offsets and using it for this bug, 2) moving the existing relative scroll offset updates consumers to the new ""pure relative"" way.
2) assumes that there isn't a good reason to encode relative scroll offset updates as the difference between two scroll positions that I missed. 
So there are a couple of open questions there. Is a purely relative scroll offset update a good idea? Should we move to the pure relative way? Or to the existing difference between absolute scroll offsets way? And how much of that work is what we want to do right now vs follow ups.",POTENTIAL_SOLUTION_DESIGN,1,90_PCT_MATCH
1651332,9,"Sorry for the delay, was on PTO Friday and AFK for most of the weekend.
Thanks, the explanation makes sense and helps a lot!
In the long term I think we'll want to handle this on the APZ side, the way we do scrollthumb dragging. But that might be a bit complicated so for the short term doing it on the main thread seems like a reasonable option. And we might need the main-thread mechanism even in the long term as a fallback if there are cases we can't handle in the compositor.
Seems reasonable, yes.
The existing mechanism for sending smooth scrolls to the compositor lives in [`ScrollFrameHelper::ApzSmoothScrollTo`](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/af5cff556a9482d7aa2267a82f2ccfaf18e797e9/layout/generic/nsGfxScrollFrame.cpp#7280) and involves setting `mApzSmoothScrollDestination` to the scroll position at the end of the smooth scroll. Currently that is (I believe) a layout viewport position, and only ever used for deduplicating smooth scroll requests, but in theory it should be possible to have it be a visual viewport position, and then use it as a ""base"" for computing a new destination in the case of multiple consecutive page scrolls. I'm not saying we *should* do this, since I'm not sure offhand if the complexity/error-prone-ness of this approach will be more or less than what you have now. But I just wanted to mention it as a possible alternative solution.
Ok. Seems like we have a lot of different options here for future consolidation :) One thing I just thought of that we might want to do regardless of which option we do is introduce a new type so that we can distinguish between layout-viewport scroll offsets (e.g. mApzScrollPos) and visual-viewport scroll offsets. That might make things a little less error-prone, and might have saved you some time during your investigations.
I don't think there is. At least, I just looked at all the places `FrameMetrics::mBaseScrollOffset` gets used and it seems to always be in combination with either `FrameMetrics::mScrollOffset` or `FrameMetrics::mSmoothScrollOffset`. So in theory we could just have `mScrollOffset` or `mSmoothScrollOffset` hold the ""pure relative"" value and use the `mIsRelative` flag to know that it's a relative value rather than an absolute value.
Yeah, I don't know the answers here, but if you have a working solution now I'm inclined to get that landed first. Then we should add a test or two to cover the situation these patches fix, and then look at followups that improve the code structure without regressing the tests.",SOLUTION_REVIEW,1,90_PCT_MATCH
1651332,10,"Oh, maybe I was wrong. There's the use at https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/af5cff556a9482d7aa2267a82f2ccfaf18e797e9/gfx/layers/FrameMetrics.h#268 which I think can't be supported if we just have a pure relative offset in the metrics.",SOLUTION_REVIEW,1,FULL_TEXT

0x13db6f000 AsyncPanZoomController::UpdateAnimation mLastSampleTime 13.096266
mLastSampleTime comes from two different sources, either GetFrameTime() or WebRenderBridgeParent::SetAPZSampleTime. The WebRenderBridgeParent::SetAPZSampleTime ones seem to be the problem.
This causes us to scroll to the right place but instantly instead of smoothly when it happens. This clearly does not seem like an issue with these patches but it would be good to resolve it before landing because otherwise these patches would regress the smooth scrolling for any users with webrender and zooming turned on (it happens even if you never pinch zoom though).",COLLATERAL_PROBLEM_ANALYSIS,0,FULL_TOKEN

Looks like the problem is we get X11 headers which `#define Status int` and then when we compile the ipdl files we include the CDM headers which have an unscoped enum named Status that gets turned into `enum int : uint32_t` which breaks building the ipdl protocols[1].
We're able to use types from the CDM headers in other ipc[2]. I'm not 100% clear on what exactly is going on with the build. Chromium have updated their headers so the enum causing us problems here no longer exists. Re-pulling the headers may be an easier way to fix this than messing with the build.

Gfx does similarly for X11 [1].
Alternatively we could find what's dragging X11 headers into the unified build and fix that. In some ways that seems more ideal, but I don't know how to quickly do that, and the above seems like a more pragmatic use of time.

1677183,4,"Here's what I ended up thinking about CORS:
Only DOM element objects have CORS.
Both DOM element objects and non-DOM objects have ""`origin-clean`"" flags.
In Gecko, we implement `origin-clean` via `isWriteOnly`, where `origin-clean` IFF `!isWriteOnly`.
See 
https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/canvas.html#the-image-argument-is-not-origin-clean for how CORS becomes `origin-clean = false`.
See https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/canvas.html#security-with-canvas-elements for how this propagates.
In particular:
I think we might have some of our CORS checks wrong, but I want to think more about it. But this is unblocked and good to land.",UNCODED,0,UNMATCHED

3. Focus the textarea (the lower/taller form control)
ACTUAL RESULTS:
In the textarea, the blinking cursor is flush with (or maybe even overlaps?) the top border.  This makes it look a bit misaligned / overflowing.
For comparison: in the textfield (the first widget), there's a little bit of space between the cursor and the borders, as of today's Nightly (thanks to bug 1686606).

1742770,5,"That's a great idea! Thanks for doing this, I imagine we'll find some useful bugs.
Yeah, we should definitely validate that we're getting a valid `moz-nullprincipal:` URI when deserializing a null principal from `PrincipalInfoToPrincipal`. It'd be nice if we could validate more than just the `moz-nullprincipal` scheme as well, though I suppose that'll be more work.
Every valid `moz-nullprincipal` URI is currently created in `NullPrincipal::CreateURI` and so follows the pattern of `moz-nullprincipal:{uuidhere-edae-4733-9a29-99abcace2a48}` with an optional `?https://precursor.spec` query at the end.

    Is there or will there be documentation that describes the schema for the ultimate data set available publicly, complete and accurate?
Yes.
    Is there a control mechanism that allows the user to turn the data collection on and off?
Yes. This collection is Telemetry so can be controlled through Firefox's Preferences.
    If the request is for permanent data collection, is there someone who will monitor the data over time?
Yes, Jeff Muizelaar is responsible.
    Using the category system of data types on the Mozilla wiki, what collection type of data do the requested measurements fall under?
Category 1, Technical.
    Is the data collection request for default-on or default-off?
Default on for all channels.
    Does the instrumentation include the addition of any new identifiers?
No.
    Is the data collection covered by the existing Firefox privacy notice?
Yes.
    Does the data collection use a third-party collection tool?
No.

Bug 1762088 - Allow to derive Parse/ToCss/SpecifiedValueInfo on bitflags. r=#style,#layout-reviewers
We keep getting this pattern of properties that have a set of joint and
disjoint flags, and copy-pasting or writing the same parsing and
serialization code in slightly different ways.
container-type is one such type, and I think we should have a single way
of dealing with this, thus implement deriving for various traits for
bitflags, with an attribute that says which flags are single vs mixed.

Bug 1762088 - Implement parsing / serialization for container{,-type,-name} CSS properties. r=#style,#layout-reviewers
Two noteworthy details that may seem random otherwise:
 * Moving values around in nsStyleDisplay is needed so that the struct
   remains under the size limit that we have to avoid jumping allocator
   buckets.
 * All the test expectation churn is because tests depend on
   `container-type: size` parsing to run, and now they run. Tests for
   the relevant bits I implemented are passing, with the only exception
   of some `container-name-computed.html` failures which are
   https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/7181. Safari agrees with
   us there.
Other notes when looking at the spec and seeing how it matches the
implementation:
 * `container` syntax doesn't match spec, but matches tests and sanity:
   https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/7180
 * `container-type` syntax doesn't _quite_ match spec, but matches tests
   and I think it's a spec bug since the definition for the missing
   keyword is gone:

I would need a more reliable repro to test this, but Sotaro is working on something to fix a similar problem in D3D11 that might fix the issue here as well if this is actually the problem.",ADDITIONAL_CONSIDERATION,0,FULL_TEXT

about:support
I don't know of any other steps or settings missing from my STR. I'll attach my about:support info. Maybe there is something peculiar about my hardware (a 2015 MacBook Pro).
Summarizing my findings:
My STR crashes on this build with a clean profile when gfx.webrender.software and gfx.canvas.accelerated are true:
`mach mozregression --launch 5c16ac03eca7a366057cb2ac7a6f376f98dd8bf0 --pref ""gfx.webrender.software:true"" ""gfx.canvas.accelerated:true"" -a ""https://results.enr.clarityelections.com/CA/Contra_Costa/114138/web.285569/#/summary""`
But doesn't crash on the same build if gfx.webrender.software or gfx.canvas.accelerated are false:
`mach mozregression --launch 5c16ac03eca7a366057cb2ac7a6f376f98dd8bf0 --pref ""gfx.webrender.software:true"" ""gfx.canvas.accelerated:false"" -a ""https://results.enr.clarityelections.com/CA/Contra_Costa/114138/web.285569/#/summary""`

* **List of other uplifts needed**: None
* **Risk to taking this patch**: Low
* **Why is the change risky/not risky? (and alternatives if risky)**: Obviously drivers can have bugs, but there should be no problem calling eglMakeCurrent(NO_SURFACE) before we call eglDestroySurface. - we must call eglMakeCurrent again prior to rendering anything anyway.
This is also what we used to do when using the old layers compositor.
* **String changes made/needed**: 
* **Is Android affected?**: Yes",REQUEST_FOR_UPLIFT,0,FULL_TOKEN

2. Press t to navigate to the table.
    - Expected: NVDA should move to the jobs table.
    - Actual: NVDA says: ""no next table""
This doesn't happen when CTW is disabled. My guess (not yet verified) is that when the table is added to the tree, it is considered a layout table, but it then mutates such that it's not a layout table. We aren't handling that mutation correctly.
This will probably be fixed by pushing a cache update for layout-guess if children are added or removed from the table.",POTENTIAL_SOLUTION_DESIGN,1,FULL_TEXT

Bug 1794237 - Ensure worst case alignment of UniformData Range when serialized. r?jgilbert
The UniformData call accepts a Range<uint8_t>. When serialized by ClientWebGLContext,
however, the data is only serialized to the alignment of the supplied uint8_t type.
The HostWebGLContext may then alias it to a Range<uint32_t> or similar, while the data
was only aligned to 1-byte alignment. On some platforms such as ARM, these unaligned
accesses can cause a SIGBUS.
As a temporary workaround, we will now pessimistically align such ranges as if they
might be accessed as any possible data type with kUniversalAlignment.",CODE_IMPLEMENTATION,1,FULL_TOKEN

If Gmail only changes the title on an already read page, you can mark that easy with .tabbrowser-tab[titleChanged]
I wouldn't like to see a tab marked unread after I did read it, only because the page likes to circle through a couple of headlines in the title.
I prefer to differ between page title and the page itself. So you have the choice to mark the tab depending on which one you want and how. Give the user a chance to decide what he wants.
If you want both marked the same way, you can do it for example like this:
/* set color for titleChanged and unread (and not selected) tabs to blue */
.tabbrowser-tab[unread],
.tabbrowser-tab[titleChanged]
{ color: blue ! important; }
You can even mark the case of a changed title on an already read tab differently (i.e. red).
Or you could use the text color for one case and the background color for the other case.
The user has the choice.",SOLUTION_REVIEW,1,FULL_TOKEN

687754,14,"I think I have answered that before in comment #6.
""titlechanged"" /= ""unread""
Basically ""unread"" says 'page is loaded from network in background' and removed as soon as the tab is selected.
It is not and should not been connected to the title. ""titlechanged"" has it's own logic when it is set and removed. You will have some overlapping but that is all. ""titlechanged"" might come without ""unread"", but it's nothing that ""unread"" has to worry about.
""unread"" tells you if you have selected (unread/read) a tab after a page was loaded from the web.
""titlechanged"" tells you if the title of a tab has changed (no matter what caused it).
To move removeAttribute(""unread"") down to where you suggested means, to put it after several ProcessListeners are started and than into or after the patch of bug 540248 (related to titlebar).
To remove unread right after selecting a tab (selected -> read) and than let the ProcessListeners get called seems the far better choice to me.
You have the chance to let both attributes lead to the same marking of the tab, like you want to. Others like me don't like that and can handle them separate or ignore ""titlechanged"".",SOLUTION_REVIEW,1,FULL_TOKEN

687754,17,"a) Maybe switching lines
to
if that seems more convenient.
This would still keep it right were the tab gets selected and viewed, the reason why ""unread"" is getting removed. It's a clear chain of commands that are logically tight connected to each other. Like removing ""busy"" leads to setting ""unread"" (if not selected). Easy to understand and maintain.
b) I can't guarantee the Listener calls do not lead to (rare) cases where ""unread"" wouldn't be removed. Is there someone able to guarantee that for now and in the future? Why even take that risk? At this point in code the tab is already selected and shouldn't have the attribute anymore.
c) After those Listeners we have the code block that handles fastFind and TitleBar if not in _previewMode.
The only connection I can see here is _previewMode.
Does it really make sense to move it down 40+ lines to save a single 'if' and at the same time loosing the easy logical understanding of why it has to be removed (selected/viewed => read) plus wondering if those Listener calls might at some point cause something related to removing ""unread"" we haven't thought of right now.
If those arguments don't catch, we can even try to move it down another 30+ lines to the TabSelect events where the _previewMode is handled too and test it there.",SOLUTION_REVIEW,1,MANUAL

Testing completed (on m-c, etc.): m-c

OK, looking good for a first start :-)
This removes the inline styles but leaves inline scripts. Can you modify crashes.xhtml so that ""onclick"" and ""onload"" attributes are replaced by JavaScript that adds event handlers (in crashes.js)?
You can look how other volunteers have fixed this (In bug 948881 for example).

Patch v2
Thanks for your help in debugging the test failure over Vidyo.
The permission observer was fired while the test was running, and the permission observer was set up to close the preferences once it had been hit. Since test case #5 adds a permission during the test run using the permission manager, the permission observer is ran before the test has completed. This caused the tab to close and thus the tree.view getting destroyed.
In the old version of the prefs, the dialog's window.close() was either being done async and/or the references to the dialog within the test kept the window alive long enough to continue the test. However, the test was still written as a no-op since the permission observer was supposed to call cleanUp which would remove the newly added permission causing the rows to be empty at the following check anyways. But... cleanUp() wasn't called, because the permObserver had a typo that was checking for `cleanup`, not `cleanUp`. This is all fixed now.",CODE_IMPLEMENTATION,1,FULL_TOKEN

1249818,6,"I'd like to sum up _facts_ about this whole thing:
1) It started in bug 887397 where _firefox_developers_ (who of course were using MacOS) decided
   to fix their flaw in Australis theme (on MacOS). There're also 2 duplicates reported for MacOS.
2) Bug 887397 was fixed in a very unusual way: instead of increasing margin (or height of empty area)
   it was decided to ""sometimes ignore mouse actions applied to background tab""
   Firefox is the only application in my lifetime which does such malicious thing.
3) As a response to bug 887397 (MacOS-only issue, remember?) there were several reports from
   Windows users. It's a real breakage on Windows (let's forget about Australis itself for now).
4) All users in CC list in bug 887397 are familiar to Nightly, except for arminwagner2008, but still
   there're no reports about this issue, and most of those people aren't even in CC list in this bug.
   I conclude that they just wanted that fancy breakage for one moment, and now they forgot about it.
5)(minor) On Windows (if you ever used it), it's really convenient to drag window using area around
   caption buttons (minimize,resize,close).
It'd be a great idea (at least on Windows) to remove the bug implemented in bug 887397 and instead create/improve a special empty area preserved for dragging OR increase draggable area above tabs as said in (2). OR compress background tabs in height (also a bad option), to avoid 'dead areas' and 'magic buttons' occurrences. OR just remove the bug 887397, because there were no such bug on Windows.
// I just noticed that I already left similar comment, but now (4) is way more actual
That's quite ""adversarial"" as well, don't you think? Yes, I meant that, and yet I'm right, see (4)
BUT, even if it was real issue, it doesn't mean that the issue must be resolved the way it was ""fixed"" in bug 887397. Moreover, it doesn't mean that MacOS users can speak for Windows users.

Are you implying that there's no good way to fix this regression? In that case we should just go ahead and remove the clip-path without waiting for UX input, since the current behavior is clearly broken and the worst of all available options.",POTENTIAL_SOLUTION_DESIGN,1,FULL_TEXT
1249818,11,"Well, removing the clip-path is one option to ""fix"" the regression instance. I am not sure whether or not there are (immediate/easy/upliftable) others, which is why I asked - I don't know that there's a way to restrict the drag stuff without e.g. applying the clip path to the tabstrip (and even then... not 100% that would fix it) which I'd expect to cause other issues (e.g. with dnd on the tabstrip).
However, I disagree that the current state is necessarily worse than the result of removing the clip path. If we accept the original reason for having the clip path, which was to avoid misclicks/drags on tabs when trying to interact with the titlebar, then the failure mode that results from removing the clip path is worse than having the clip path be dead space. That is, if you try and move a window or otherwise interact with the titlebar and ""miss"" and hit the tabs instead, ""nothing happens"" is better than ""you detach a tab into a window"" or ""you change tab selection and lose your context"".

[Describe test coverage new/current, TreeHerder]: the patch contains an xpcshell test.
[Risks and why]: low; one line fix, modifying the engine id, which is only ever used during metadata migration.

45ESR (update to) 45.0.1 ESR

Ubuntu -> reproducible
The update/migration bug can be verified fixed on WINDOWS and UBUNTU for 45.0.1, 45.0.1 ESR with the note that (comment 1) wasn't reproducible on MAC. 
II. 
What I noticed for all OS'es was that installing the language pack and setting the "" general.useragent.locale to 'de' "", then just restarting FF was causing the search engines settings to break. (behavior reproducible for 44.02, 45, 45.01, 45.01ESR)

1254694,36,"Unless I'm misunderstanding something, II. may not be a real issue. When you switch to a different language pack, you switch to a different set of default search engines, so settings can't really be kept, or at least not all of them. We may want to try to preserve the settings automatically for engines that have the same name for both languages (eg. 'Google'), but that's not something we should attempt to do in a dot release. Us losing some settings when the user actively switches back and forth between languages is very different from (and less problematic than) losing settings during an update.",CLARIFICATION,0,FULL_TEXT

So some solutions came to me are to move some code to content window altogether. The selections may be like
1. Just move the event listener out to content window. And when we need to communicate something between listener and  framescript we just dispatch a new CustomEvent.
2. Move almost all the code out to the content window, but we're not able to move them out completely since we still need some code from framescript for jobs like accessing properties in the future.

In bug 1357517, Preferences.get was replaced by getStringPref.  In bug 1397379, we added an `undefined` parameter to it as the default return value, to avoid it throwing an error.
That worked in preventing the error from being thrown, but turns out that the value returned is actually `null` instead of `undefined` (as documented in bug 1357517 comment 63), but the switch statement below only checks for `undefined`.
[Tracking Requested - why for this release]:
Breaks the Flash Click-to-Play rollout for fresh profiles. Note: this is *not* a regression from bug 1390705. It is from bug 1357517, which should have been fixed by 1397379, but the fix was incomplete.",PROBLEM_CAUSE_IDENTIFICATION,0,FULL_TOKEN

1421905,2,"Thank you for the report and for the regression range.
What I'm seeing here is a good ol' race: in the sidebar initialization code, in some rare cases we might update the UI before we are done initializing Weave.Service [0][1][2]. That means we show a blank screen.
From there it all goes downhill: since the tab engine is disabled, SyncedTabs.jsm never triggers a UI update since it only listens to ""tab engine sync finished"" events [3]. So we stay on that blank screen forever.
A simple fix is to listen to ""weave:service:ready"", so we can update the UI one last time.
Ultimately, I don't think isConfiguredToSyncTabs is the right abstraction because it assumes that the tab engine is enabled if Service is not ready. We should refactor that to explicitly make the distinction between these states, but it is a bit more work.
Patch to come.

The following reproduces only on a FF client when using a new non-existent preference added manually from about:config.
[Prerequisites:]
You need access to New Admin interface (https://normandy-admin.stage.mozaws.net/control-new)
1. Set the app.normandy.dev_mode preference to true to run recipes immediately on startup.
2. Set the app.normandy.logging.level preference to 0 to enable more logging.
3. Set the security.content.signature.root_hash preference to DB:74:CE:58:E4:F9:D0:9E:E0:42:36:BE:6C:C5:C4:F6:6A:E7:74:7D:C0:21:42:7A:03:BC:2F:57:0C:8B:9B:90.
4. Set the preference value for app.normandy.api_url set to https://normandy.stage.mozaws.net/api/v1
[Steps:]
1. Open Firefox client with a new profile.
2. Open about:config in a new tab and right click and add a new preferences: e.g. non_existent_preference, int, with value 10.
3. Open Admin center and create a new rollout type recipe, targeting the step2 preference, changing the value to something else, e.g. 12.
4. Publish step 3 recipe.
5. On the profile from step 1, set prerequisites and restart.
6. Open browser console and check the results.
[Actual Result:]

Unfortunately I don't have access to a Windows machine or a VM atm-- maybe someone with one could take a look and see if this patch works and if it causes further issues.
This patch also includes tests, but they're WIP and some of them fail/hang the browser. Dao, if you have time, would you mind taking a look to see if there's something obviously wrong with the tests, esp the right-click test? That's the one that hangs. I haven't written too many of these so it might be a beginner's mistake.

1565273,6,"This bug doesn't affect me on my Mac. I think the bad behaviour is caused by the Windows platform gate (removed in the attached patch), meaning this issue only affects Windows. This bug is independent of the `browser.urlbar.clickSelectsAll` pref and whether `clickSelectsAll` happens at all -- it only affects contextmenu clicks, and only the contextmenu handler has the Windows platform gate.
The Windows platform gate originates here: https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/content/widgets/textbox.xml#248. I ported it over to the UrlbarInput contextmenu handler when I was removing the clickSelectsAll behaviour from XUL textboxes.

1571472,13,"Hey rhelmer,
Coming at this having not really examined the patches, Corroborate.jsm, or anything like that, but I've seen failures like this before.
So we have this whitelist of main-thread IO for different stages of start-up. We fail in one of two cases:
1. We see new IO that isn't already in the whitelist
2. We fail to see IO that is in the whitelist
The error message that you're seeing is for case (2) - we expected to see some IO, and we didn't. This can be a good thing - in the best case, presuming this isn't intermittent, it means that we've successfully moved some IO off of the main thread and now we need to update the whitelist.
Here are the relevant parts of the log:

So looking at the log, before that first failure, we see 1 expected stat on application/firefox/user.ja, and then we leave the ""before handling user events"" stage before seeing the other stat, and then the test freaks out because we didn't see the remaining XCurProcD:omni.ja or the one remaining GreD:omni.ja.

1634650,1,"Currently, it is only possible to whitelist complete domains and prevent them from redirecting to search using `browser.fixup.domainwhitelist.yourdomain.yoursuffix`.
It should also be possible to also whitelist whole suffixes/TLDs. This is useful in case of local development using reserved TLDs (bug 1634592) because users don't need to manually whitelist every domain. It is also useful with non-IANA-managed TLDs like OpenNIC or extensions that add support for domains of some other project (like `.eth` or `.bit`).
Although reserved TLDs and OpenNIC domains use a custom DNS server, so Firefox can use that to offer users to automatically whitelist a certain domain, this can't be said for extension-based domains. For such domains, the only way of accessing them is to manually whitelist every domain in `about:config` or manually type `http://` before the domain.
It should also be possible to also whitelist whole suffixes/TLDs. With this, users could just add, for example, `.local`, `.libre` or `.eth` as a whitelisted suffix and all search queries with that suffix will be interpreted as website/domain request.
Additionally, API for whitelisting suffixes/TLDs could be exposed to extensions. This would be useful in cases where extensions are used for handling custom domains (like MetaMask for `.eth`, PeerName or Blockchain DNS for `.bit`, `.emc` and few others...). Without such API, users would have to install such extension and them manually whitelist suffix/TLD that extension uses. With such API, users would just need to install the extension, and extension would automatically register TLDs that it handles as whitelisted domain TLDs.",PROBLEM_MOTIVATION,0,FULL_TOKEN
1634650,2,"I have some idea how whitelisting suffixes could look like:
Pref could be something like `browser.fixup.suffixwhitelist.yoursuffix`, so all searches which end with `.yoursuffix` would be considered as URLs. Additionally, if pref is set to, for example `browser.fixup.suffixwhitelist.local.domain`, searches which end with `.local.domain` would be considered as URLs, but searches ending on  just `.domain` won't be.
For extensions API for whitelisting TLDs, there are more approaches:
1. If an extension requires host permission (in the manifest) for specific domain/URL, automatically treat that URL as whitelisted domain/suffix. For example, if extension requires `*://*.bit/*`, automatically treat all searches ending with `.bit` as whitelisted suffixes, and if extension requires `*://*.local.domain`, treat searches ending with `.local.domain` as URLs. The benefit is that it doesn't require changing most of the extensions. However, the problem with this is that it is not really configurable. But much configuration is probably not really needed here, because if extension wants to access websites on some suffix, we can assume that that suffix contains websites.
2. Providing another manifest permission similar to host permission, which is only used to tell Firefox that specific suffix should be whitelisted. The advantage is that it is more configurable. Disadvantages are that the extension would need to be updated to start using it, and would probably result in duplicated configuration/permissions (you would need to set both normal host permission and this new ""suffix permission"" in manifest). And in most, if not all, cases, separate configuration probably won't be needed.
3. Exposing API to JavaScript in some way. The advantage is that it is dynamic. Disadvantage is also that is dynamic, which means that is is probably harder to handle it, and can also cause security and usability problems. And probably also results in duplicated configuration.
Of those three approaches, I most like first, because it doesn't result in too much configuration and can work with existing extensions.",POTENTIAL_SOLUTION_DESIGN,1,90_PCT_MATCH

By default we should whitelist the reserved TLDs from bug 1634592.
It may be useful to also have a policy.
I don't think we can add suffix providers as prefs though, we'd need an updated list in the product, like the PSL, to support an high number of suffixes, we don't have such a list.
A WebExtension API is an interesting idea, but honestly it should be filed separately. I must note though that currently the isDomainWhitelisted API we use is synchronous and it would not cope well with the async WebExt API, thus someone should either fix all the isDomainWhitelisted call points (not trivial) or figure out an API that just updates an in-memory list asynchronously, and accept that some hits may fail.

It seems to only affect Linux 18.04 x64 shippable opt, that makes me think if we can't get a useful stack, we may have to skip-if = os == ""linux"" && bits == 64 && !debug, but of course I'd prefer to find what's up.",SOLUTION_VERIFICATION,0,FULL_TOKEN
1634650,15,"Interesting. I wonder if this might be something related to bug 1607713, which is a high intermittent crash with the ""new"" Ubuntu 18.04 jobs. 
Maybe we could try to run the Marionette job with the old 16.04 image on try and check if the test passes fine there with a couple of retriggers. I would assume we have to add a worker setting like for our [puppeteer jobs](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/dc4560dcaafd79375b9411fdbbaaebb0a59a93ac/taskcluster/ci/source-test/remote.yml#20-22) to the [Marionette Taskcluster configs](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/dc4560dcaafd79375b9411fdbbaaebb0a59a93ac/taskcluster/ci/test/marionette.yml#5).",COLLATERAL_PROBLEM_ANALYSIS,0,90_PCT_MATCH
1634650,16,"So, we are in testResetEverything.
The restart we crash on is apparently the one after the first checkProfile.
One thing I don't understand, by looking at a PASS log, is why after the first self.checkProfile(expect_sync_user=True) and the restart, I cannot find traces of the second self.checkProfile(has_migrated=True, expect_sync_user=True), I instead see a TEST-PASS just after the restart.
For example, looking for the string ""services.sync.username"" in the log, I see it set by self.createProfileData() and then get by the first self.checkProfile(expect_sync_user=True), then I don't see it again, but the second self.checkProfile call should get it again, it's like we don't run the second checkProfile at all.",COLLATERAL_PROBLEM_ANALYSIS,0,FULL_TOKEN

So my patch implies that these infobars aren't displayed anymore (the innerHeight property isn't the same).
Since I can reproduce locally, I made a try in keeping only pdf tests and `test_user_select` in the `mochitest.ini` and of course everything runs fine !? so something else is wrong.
Using luck and dichotomy, I managed to get similars errors with `test_user_select` with this basic `mochitest.ini`:
```ini
[test_meta_viewport_fixed_width_and_zero_display_width.html]
[test_user_select.html]
```

1705327,15,"Ok, so the logical fix seems to be to pair [this call to `pushPrefEnv()`](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/6a41d8d7ad42d57cf1adcc7067fd8f1689c42ab3/dom/base/test/test_meta_viewport_fixed_width_and_zero_display_width.html#19) (which changes `layout.css.devPixelsPerPx`) with a corresponding call to `popPrefEnv()` at the end of the test.
However, this does not seem to have the desired effect. While the device pixel ratio is changed back to 60, and we get e.g. a call to [`AppUnitsPerDevPixelChanged()`](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/6a41d8d7ad42d57cf1adcc7067fd8f1689c42ab3/layout/base/nsPresContext.cpp#427) for it, the visible area of the root content document's pres shell remains stuck at a size corresponding to the old ratio, and while the root content doc does get reflowed, it's reflowed into this stale size.
I'm not sure what is supposed to trigger the updating of the pres shell's visible area and a reflow to the correct size after the device pixel ratio changes. cc'ing Emilio in case he has some ideas.
Perhaps changing `layout.css.devPixelsPerPx`, which is an action that affects the mochitest harness document itself, is not a well-behaved thing for a mochitest to be doing in the first place?",COLLATERAL_POTENTIAL_SOLUTION,0,90_PCT_MATCH

1715838,1,"In order to get started on Bug 1696573, we'll want to create a pref to ""hide"" the ongoing screenshots refactor. This will help us land patches and ensure we do not break current screenshots functionality. 1 will be in progress, and the other is the current implementation.
This is very similar to how we implemented the new print preview with `print.tab_modal.enabled` [[1]]. If the pref is true, taking a screenshot should bring up the new screenshots UI (maintained as a browser component). If false, we should operate with the current setup. 
We'll have to add the pref to `StaticPrefList.yaml`, similar to the printing pref [[2]].
Then, in the places where we usually make calls to the screenshots extension UI [[3]] [[4]], we should notify the observers if the pref is false. As a reference, here is how the printing service would accomplish that: https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/2c991232499e826e46f9d976eb653817340ba389/toolkit/components/printing/content/printUtils.js#38-43,342-343

When you have the ""menu bar"" enabled (the one with File, Edit, View etc) move your mouse over any of them, don't click, just move the mouse over it, then move it anywhere else, again without clicking it.
Actual results:

Hrm, this image (and the 2x version) doesn't seem to be in the patch. Did you forget to |hg add| it?
I actually kind of prefer having it all on one line, much easier to copy/paste and replace.
aw yeah proper bracing style
This string concatenation may not be acceptable for localization and/or RTL. I think we might need to do something like http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/1b49fb552e18/browser/base/content/aboutDialog.xul#l71, where we allow localizers to add text before and after the link. But I'm not certain about this - ask Axel?
Seems like it might be simpler to just have this code be something like:
let knowYourRightsData = AboutHomeUtils.knowYourRightsData;
if (knowYourRightsData)
  docElt.setAttribute(...)
and have AboutHomeUtils return null when nothing needs to be shown (and have the code in aboutHome.js just check for the presence of the attribute, rather than rightsData.show).
Hrm, now it's starting to seem gratuitous :)
clearUserPref before setBoolPref is redundant, FWIW.
You should remove it from EXTRA_JS_MODULES if you're adding it here, otherwise we will copy it over twice unecessarily during build time.

Over the years I've adopted the practice to 'correct' coding style mis-alignments whenever I touch that code directly. My idea behind this is that doing it like this gives me the idea that we keep striving for a uniform codebase, while not acting like style-nazi and start correcting each and every flaw in random files.
This is off-topic, but I wanted to mention it anyway: when I look at the codebase as a whole, I get the feeling that too many patches were landed in the past where reviewers eventually skipped over the nits.

Update as oer Gavin's review and comments
Seems like you shouldn't add the related style yet, then (or the empty #rightsSnippet {} block).
Please avoid making the bracing changes in this patch.
This could check ""rightsData.start || rightsData.end"" to be localization-agnostic (we don't currently run browser-chrome tests in non-en-US builds, but we might want to someday).
Wouldn't a more accurate description be ""after it has already been shown once (in the previous test)""?
Hrm, don't think is kosher. IIRC formatStringFromName can do bad things if it's expecting a variable to substitute and doesn't find one in the string. Axel would probably know the details. But in any case it seems like this would be simpler if you added the relevant strings to aboutHome.dtd, similar to how abouthome.defaultSnippet1.v1 works:
<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (rightsSnippet.message) text in <a> will be linked to about:rights -->
<!ENTITY rightsSnippet.message ""&brandShortName; is free and open source software from the non-profit Mozilla Foundation. <a>Know your rights…</a>"">
and then have the about:home code linkify the <a> appropriately.
(I think both this link and the default snippet links should actually be branding-specific, i.e. in brand.dtd, but I can file a separate bug about that.)
It's a bit risky that the setting of the ""shown"" pref is now decoupled from the actual showing. This currently relies on the AboutHomeUtils.knowYourRightsData getter only ever being called when about:home is going to be displayed, which seems a bit fragile. It would be nice to avoid that somehow - I suppose you could just move this block of code to the browser.js block where the AboutHomeUtils.knowYourRightsData is currently accessed.
This #define will never be true, because you didn't also move over the block at:

Know Your Rights notification box has moved to be shown as default snippet on first startup
Hrm, does this work? In HTML its the existence of the ""hidden"" attribute that matters, rather than its value, so I would think this would need to be removeAttribute(""hidden"")... Oh, I see that you added a #rightsSnippet[hidden=false] rule - just switch this and remove that, I think.
Might be worth adding a comment that this stuff all needs to happen before setting searchEngineURL, since that's what triggers the display of the snippets.
nit: these checks are redundant, and the term ""attribute value"" is kind of vague. Since you're checking that the snippet was actually shown anyways, I don't think it's useful to check the AboutHomeUtils getter directly.
nit: similarly, this doesn't accurately describe what it's checking. The value of AboutHomeUtils.knowYourRightsData doesn't reflect whether a snippet was shown, so adjust the message accordingly.
This is not actually used anymore so perhaps you shouldn't add it.
You can get rid of the corresponding DEFINES line in browser/components/Makefile.in now, since this is its only use.
""will be linked to about:rights""
Seems like this should just return a boolean.
nit: copy/paste means these lines are indented too much

The more times you ask me to review this the more comments I'll find :P
This shouldn't be needed, since ""hidden"" in HTML should just work?
FWIW clearUserPref now never throws (since bug 487059), so the try/catches aren't necessary.
The default value of this pref differs depending on whether DEBUG is defined, so I think this test may not work consistently.
I also just realized that the test profile has browser.EULA.override set (http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/3a5929ebc886/build/automation.py.in#l485), which may be messing with these tests in unexpected ways.

- on incremental builds, we re-use dist/bin, which contains aboutRights.properties from a previous build.

- the package is unpacked for l10n-check
- then a new directory is created for the x-test locale, and filled according to the jar manifests, thus not copying aboutRights.properties.
- the l10n-repack code wants all chrome locale files from the original locale (en-US, coming from the unpacked package) to be found in the new locale (x-test, filled above), and fails because x-test doesn't have aboutRights.properties.
Maybe we should remove dist/bin when starting an incremental build as we currently do for sdk, include, etc. That would avoid a clobber in such cases.",COLLATERAL_PROBLEM_ANALYSIS,0,FULL_TOKEN

Taking a look at our current ""first run"" default snippet as well as our two other default snippets (pointing to features and addons) - I would like to explore in updating copy/icon and CTAs. Are there legal ramifications or reasons that these snippets have to be what they currently are or do we have the flexibility to change them?
Please let me know, thanks!

The wording of the ""first run"" snippet was chosen carefully, since it was a straight replacement for the ""know your rights"" info bar. Changing that would require a discussion to make sure that we're not losing important first-run messaging.
The wording and style of the other two ""default snippets"" are completely open to modification - feel free to file a bug and CC me to discuss any changes.",ANSWER_TO_QUESTION,0,FULL_TOKEN

STR is pretty simple just enabling e10s on OSX on any nightly for me totally makes scrollbars stop working. Would you like a video? There is no step to reproduce aside from enabling e10s and them immediately not working once the browser restarts.

restart.js
I was finally able to reproduce this. My STR (likely not minimal, but it's a start):
0) Make sure Firefox is set up to restore your tabs / windows from last time when starting up
1) Open a single tab in Firefox that is long (requires a vertical scrollbar). The root document needs to be long - no CSS trickery (so a dxr page is no good. This Bugzilla bug is probably a good page to load, actually).
2) Make sure devtools.chrome.enabled and devtools.debugger.remote-enabled are set to true
3) Open up the Scratchpad from DevTools, and in the titlebar, set Environment to Browser
4) Paste the script I've attached to this bug (""restart.js"") into the Scratchpad, and click ""Run""
The browser should restart and load the test page. Every now and then, the vertical scrollbar is missing.",S2R,0,FULL_TOKEN
1096093,25,"Ok, I have more minimal STR:
0) Make sure Firefox is set up to restore your tabs / windows from last time when starting up and is using e10s.
1) Make sure a mouse is plugged in, and make sure that OS X is configured to show scrollbars ""Automatically based on mouse or trackpad"" (that's in System Preferences > General).
2) Open this bug in one tab, and then again in a second tab.
3) Quit the browser
4) Start the browser
5) Note that the initial re-opened browser has overlay scrollbars instead of the inline scrollbars.
6) Switch to the other tab - notice that the scrollbar track is just a blank area.",S2R,0,FULL_TOKEN
1096093,26,"Maybe it's helpful or not, but if you restore session from about:home this bug does not reproduce.  What is it doing that's different from update or on restart session restore?",QUESTION,0,FULL_TEXT
1096093,27,"I suspect the flurry of remote browsers being restored on a restart is contributing to a race that we're less likely to hit after start-up has completed. I also suspect that if about:home was a tall page and had a scrollbar, we'd hit this again. I will actually try that experiment.",PROBLEM_CAUSE_IDENTIFICATION,0,FULL_TEXT
1096093,28,"So I've done a bit of analysis, and here are my findings:
Suppose we're starting Firefox and it automatically restores a session where the selected browser has a vertical scrollbar.
In single-process Firefox on post-Lion OS X, we don't initially draw the scrollbar, because we assume that we're using overlay scrollbars. We're constantly polling this nsLookAndFeel metric for overlay scrollbars and it's returning ""true"".
OS X has noticed that we're asking about the scrollbars, and after it's done an analysis of the peripherals and user preferences, it tells us ""Actually, we're supposed to use permanent scrollbars here"". nsChildView.mm hears that via the NSPreferredScrollerStyleDidChangeNotification that gets handled by ChildView's scrollbarSystemMetricChanged method. This causes nsPresContext to realize that the theme has changed, and it flushes all caches of the look and feel, and recomputes the layout of the page to draw the scrollbars correctly.
In the multi-process case, the look-and-feel metric changes, but the child never hears about the scrollbarSystemMetricChanged event, because the content process doesn't have a ChildView. So the nsPresContext never gets ThemeChanged called on it, and we don't re-lay out the page.
So that's the problem. I'm evaluating solutions now.",PROBLEM_CAUSE_IDENTIFICATION,0,FULL_TOKEN

1096093,55,"Hey jimm,
I pushed my last set of patches up to Try, and oranged out because the LookAndFeel stuff was getting initted when the ContentChild was starting up, and without a display (like when running xpcshell tests), that was causing our GTK self-tests to fail.
After consulting with karlt, my solution is to have LookAndFeel in the content process query the parent only when nsXPLookAndFeel::Init is called (so only when layout/painting needs LookAndFeel).

593387,17,I'm not sure what you mean; what policy are you trying to enforce?,QUESTION,0,FULL_TEXT
593387,18,"X-Frame-Options 1) restricts ""DENY"" documents from being framed in any context and 2) restricts ""SAMEORIGIN"" documents to be framed only if the top-level browsing context is the same origin as the document.
This bug is about adding exceptions to the above policy for chrome.  We want to allow chrome to frame any resource but we don't want to allow content to frame other content if it would violate any of the above policy.
My thinking about GetSameTypeRootTreeItem is:
1) any inner content document with X-F-O: DENY should be blocked if there exists a content docshell anywhere in its parent chain
2) any inner content document with X-F-O: SAMEORIGIN should be blocked if the top content docshell in its parent chain is a different origin
3) we don't need to worry about the ""content > chrome > content"" chain because we don't allow content to frame chrome in any case
How does that sound?

If we go forward with comment 26, the only cases where we end up with less secure behavior is if chrome frames a page that in turn frames another page who doesn't want to be framed.  This proposal would allow that inner page to be framed because the top-level context is chrome.  For there to be any real security impact, the page we chose to frame under the top-level chrome document would have to be a bad actor and do something malicious with the page it in turn framed (e.g. clickjacking).  It seems highly unlikely that we would frame any web content in the product that we don't trust or have control over.

If the document that has the system principal were loaded in a type=""chrome"" docshell itself, there would be no issue; X-Frame-Options would not treat it as the root document for the content and everything would Just Work (this is the case for the browser itself, say, where the XUL document for the UI is loaded in a chrome docshell and has type=""content"" subframes).  But the ""ui in tab"" thing is implemented in a particularly silly way in that it uses type=""content"" docshells.  As a result, anything that gets same-type docshell parents for subframes of that UI will find the docshell the UI is loaded in (e.g. if you frame AMO in the addons manager, window.top evaluated on AMO will actually return the addons manager window).  So X-Frame-Options is finding the addons UI as the root docshell, and you get this bug.

So, this patch does two things.  First, it uses the onfocus event handler on input elements to make sure to run the test only when they're focused.  It also modifies the reftest platform to make sure that the window is raised and focused before running each test.

Patch (v1)
So, Neil said that the main reason behind the problem is that the XUL browser element inside the chrome document is not focused.  Calling gBrowser.focus() seems to solve the problem.
So, I've fixed that problem in this patch.  I've also modified the placeholder reftests to actually depends on the focus event.  This means that they would still fail if the window is not focused, but they would time out this time, which is a lot better (at least, it's not misleading as a rendering problem.)

Are you sure? The existing failure mode without --disable-e10s is that the initial computed values are null, which I always assumed was because we call Servo_Init in nsAppRunner rather than nsLayoutStatics [1]. The reason for this, which is explained above [1], is obsoleted by your patches. So I think we just need another patch to move the calls back to nsLayoutStatics.
Yeah, I realized that we're currently building both e10s and non-e10s, so we're actually good there.

safeguard patch
This would still trigger assertion in existing versions, but won't crash.
I tried to thoroughly fix it, but failed to figure out how.
This bug happened at the end of nsINode::doRemoveChildAt().
That method calls nsXULElement::UnbindFromTree() there, which calls nsFrameLoader::Destroy() -> nsDocument::SetSubDocumentFor() to remove the child document from the XUL document, then calls nsElement::UnbindFromTree() -> nsDocument::ExitFullscreen() to exit fullscreen on the root document. Since the child document has been detached at this point, we won't be able to visit that document to exit fullscreen there.
Then the method calls the destructor of mozAutoDocUpdate, which eventually calls nsDocument::OnPageHide() which again tries to exit fullscreen, but finds the root has exited fullscreen.
Not sure how this is fixed in the current m-i.
I thought about replacing FullscreenRoots with FullscreenLeaves to track the leaf documents instead of roots. That could work now, but once the Fullscreen API spec is updated so that the fullscreen element is no longer necessarily in the same containing chain, maintaining the list of leaf documents could be more tricky.",CODE_IMPLEMENTATION,1,FULL_TOKEN

- Locate your profile directory (you can find this in about:support in the Profile Folder entry).
- In that directory there should be a `gmp-widevinecdm` dir, inside that there should be a `4.10.1196.0` directory, inside that dir there should be 5 files, a license, a manifest, and 3 widevine files. These files are the CDM.

- Start Firefox (with the profile we've changed the CDM for).
- Check if this fixes the issue.

This fixes all of the -Wformat-extra-args warnings and all of the -Wformat-security warnings except the ones in fsmcnf.c and fsmdef.c which are caused by the format parameter being the return of another function (get_debug_string).  I chose not to address those since that would entail getting replacing all of the get_debug_string calls with literals.

1821213,8,"It looks like implementing `NSWindowDelegate windowWillUseStandardFrame: defaultFrame:` in Bug 1820699 has caused the browser windows opened in reftests to be larger than they were before, causing [this case to be missed](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/2af0d81d29bcd264083e04a2473d82a91f0f7eb6/layout/tools/reftest/reftest.jsm#981), which makes the reftest harness think that it's not checking all of the pixels. Something like that. There may be a logic relaxation we can do that will make this work again.",PROBLEM_CAUSE_IDENTIFICATION,0,90_PCT_MATCH

1821213,10,"The enclosing window, instead of retaining its expected 800 x 1000 size, is being shrunk to 760 x 960 size, which is 20 pixels taken from each edge, which is a magic number used in Bug 1820699. That shrinking is only supposed to happen when there is a request to put the macOS window in ""normal"" state, but the window appears stuck in ""maximized"" state. The maximized state is determined by the window being very close to the bounds of the screen on which it appears. Since the real screen is larger than 800 x 1000, there's perhaps some screen-spoofing that is done in the reftest harness that makes the window think it is filling the screen.
Things I'll try:
1) See if there is screen-spoofing, figure out what to do about it.
2) See how the reftest harness is requesting normal state, and make it not do so if the window is already in maximized state.
3) Make the macOS forced shrink not happen in the reftest harness using some other heuristic.",POTENTIAL_SOLUTION_DESIGN,1,90_PCT_MATCH

1363344,1,"Lately we've had a number of cases where after a merge from m-c to graphics we end up with permafail or high-frequency intermittent failures on QR tests. These take time to bisect and is not a reliable process because of the potential intermittency. Avoid this is one reason I want to start running the QR reftests on autoland/inbound and make them tier-1, so that anything that regresses them gets detected earlier and backed out.
Also eventually we're going to want this anyway because we'd like to stop working on the graphics branch and move to working directly on central. Turning on the tests on central/integration branches is a necessary prerequisite for this.
The downside to doing this, of course, is we'll need more machine time. Right now all we want to enable are linux64 tests which I hear is the cheapest to scale up. If we can use SETA to further reduce the number of times it runs that's fine by me, as long as the sheriffs have the ability to backfill and bisect as needed.",PROBLEM_DESCRIPTION,0,FULL_TOKEN

This patch affects the following linux64-qr test jobs (for both opt and debug):
- Stops running reftest-no-accel on central, since they don't seem to provide
  much value over regular reftests.
- Starts running mochitest-gpu on central.
- Starts running crashtests, reftests, jsreftests, mochitest-gpu and
  mochitest-webgl on mozilla-inbound and autoland (this matches the set of
  tests on central).
- Promotes all the tests running on central/autoland/inbound to tier-1.

patch (against 54625:7dcc52c49fc4)
insBranch() can return NULL if a conditional branch is optimized so that its condition never succeeds.  jstracer.cpp doesn't account for this, it just calls branch->setTarget(label).  This hasn't mattered up until now, but with bug 600127 doing a better job of optimizing guard/branch conditions, it does matter.
This patch adds label() to handle this.",CODE_IMPLEMENTATION,1,FULL_TEXT
